//! The [`Engine`] — the instantiable owner of all runtime state (no globals,
//! so several engines can coexist, e.g. for meta-interpreters).
//!
//! Internally it is split into an immutable-during-reduction `Signature`
//! (sorts, symbols, compiled equations) and a mutable `Runtime` (the GC'd DAG arena, roots, and
//! rewrite statistics): matching and instantiation hold a *shared* borrow of the signature while
//! mutating the runtime, so a rewrite instantiates an equation's right-hand side straight out of
//! the still-borrowed equation table — no defensive clone. [`Engine`] is a thin facade that
//! re-exposes the same public API over the two halves.
//!
//! It computes each node's least sort at construction and runs garbage collection
//! (non-moving mark-sweep) over the DAG from an explicit root set.
