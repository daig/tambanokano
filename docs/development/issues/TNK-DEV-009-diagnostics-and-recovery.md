# TNK-DEV-009 — Diagnostics and invalid-input recovery

**Status:** Known gap  
**Type:** Correctness and user experience  
**Current contract:** [`docs/manual.md` §0.5 and Appendix H.3–H.4](../../manual.md#05-diagnostics-limits-and-invalid-input)

## Current behavior

Appendix H.4 is the user-facing ledger for known invalid-input and unsupported seams. It records silent token skipping, repaired declarations, nonuniform attribute handling, dropped statements, inert hooks/controls, incomplete command output, and one process-killing cyclic-subsort panic. These behaviors are Experimental and are not accepted-input guarantees.

## Developer work

The long-term direction is uniform ownership and state effects, not exact Maude warning prose. Work should be split by owning boundary while preserving the common classifications in `TNK-DOC-006`:

1. eliminate process panic for cyclic subsorts and return a sort/declaration diagnostic without installing a partial definition;
2. make invalid declaration attributes reject or recover consistently and visibly;
3. make equation/rule/membership attribute parsing follow one policy;
4. diagnose unsupported hooks and unknown Session controls without claiming success;
5. expose unsupported unification and SMT `BadDag` outcomes distinctly from no result;
6. retain atomic module/view and command state transitions on failure.

## Constraints

- Accepted valid input must not change behavior while invalid-input recovery is corrected.
- Diagnostics need stable category and state effect; prose need not become a compatibility surface.
- A repaired declaration must never retain a silently different semantic theory without a documented policy.
- Panic-hook output is not a Session diagnostic.
- Fixes should defend public `Session` and CLI behavior, not source-text implementation details.

## Completion gate

Appendix H.4 shrinks as cases acquire behavior consistent with H.3. The issue closes only when no listed case panics, silently performs a different semantic operation, or produces an ambiguous success/no-result record. Remaining deliberate unsupported behavior moves to Appendix K with an explicit diagnostic/effect.

## Provenance

This issue replaces future-work commentary embedded in the user-facing recovery ledger. The manual continues to describe current observable behavior until each fix ships.
