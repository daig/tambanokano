# TNK-DEV-012 — SMT search and result-reporting gaps

**Status:** Known gap  
**Type:** SMT feature and presentation  
**Current contract:** [`docs/manual.md` §14 and Appendix H/K](../../manual.md#14-smt-constrained-operations)

## Current behavior

- `smt-search =>!` is unsupported and rejected without creating a search or continuation.
- A configured backend `BadDag` result currently produces the command echo without a distinct backend-answer line.
- `Unknown`, `BadDag`, explicit bounds, finite no-solution, and incompleteness are semantically distinct even when `Eval` cannot represent every distinction structurally.

## Missing work

### Normal-form SMT search

Supporting `=>!` requires a precise normal-form acceptance rule under accumulated constraints, including how unknown feasibility affects terminal-state classification and continuation.

### Result reporting

`BadDag` needs an explicit user-visible outcome consistent with `TNK-DOC-006`. A future typed Session API should carry the backend result directly; the text API still needs an unambiguous record.

## Constraints

- Never reinterpret `Unknown` or `BadDag` as satisfiable, unsatisfiable, or no solution.
- The default null backend remains a valid profile and returns `Unknown` rather than pretending to solve.
- Query-local solver state and push/pop isolation must remain intact.
- Bounds and backend uncertainty cannot produce an exhaustion claim.

## Completion gate

The reporting slice closes when every backend result has an unambiguous Session record and tests cover state/continuation effects. The `=>!` slice requires constrained terminal-state tests for Sat, Unsat, Unknown, bounds, and continuation before the Reference can list it as supported.
