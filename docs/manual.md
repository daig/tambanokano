# The TNK Language and System Reference

**Document status:** normative for the repository at workspace version `0.1.0`
**Reference edition:** 2026-08-01
**Implementation name:** tambanokano (`tnk`)

This document specifies TNK as an independent rewriting-logic system. It defines the product's user-visible semantics and embedding contracts. Maude is part of the implementation lineage and can supply historical regression baselines, but it does not define TNK or set a compatibility target.

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY** are normative. A paragraph carrying a `TNK-*` identifier is a stable contract clause.

## 0. How to read this reference

### 0.1 Normative hierarchy

**TNK-DOC-001 — Authority.** Contract clauses define intended TNK behavior. If this Reference is ambiguous, the behavior is unspecified until a clause resolves it. Rustdoc and the compiler define the exact Rust type and ownership surface of the installed release; this Reference defines its semantic behavior. `TNK-RECOVERY-001` separately records tentative current-release behavior at named invalid-input seams, including known deviations from the intended contracts.

### 0.2 Feature states

**TNK-DOC-002 — Feature classification.** Every public feature has exactly one of these states:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Stable** | Supported behavior whose documented contract applies to every conforming implementation. |
| **Experimental** | Implemented and usable, but subject to incompatible change between releases. |
| **Optional** | Supported only with a named build feature, backend, or loaded-library capability; absence has a specified result. |
| **Unsupported** | Recognized or adjacent syntax has no supported semantics and is rejected, left inert, or warned about as specified. |

“Accepted by the parser” is not a separate state. Accepted syntax whose semantic hook is unavailable is **Unsupported**, not silently partially supported.

### 0.3 Behavior vocabulary

The feature state and the variability of one behavior are separate classifications:

- **specified** behavior is fixed by a clause and is required of every conforming implementation in the applicable profile;
- **unspecified** behavior has no promised value, order, spelling, or consistency between calls or releases;
- **implementation-defined** behavior is not portable, but an implementation MUST document its choice for the referenced release and obey every invariant stated here;
- **backend-dependent** behavior may vary only over the outcomes named for the selected backend/profile. The active backend MUST be discoverable from build configuration or the embedding boundary.

An implementation-defined order is not an Experimental feature, and an Optional feature is not unspecified when enabled.

### 0.4 Scope of conformance

**TNK-DOC-003 — Conforming implementation.** A conforming TNK implementation MUST:

- accept every Stable source and command form specified here;
- produce the specified mathematical result, state transition, and completion classification;
- enforce the specified bounds and recovery boundaries;
- preserve documented Session state transitions;
- distinguish success, finite failure, incompleteness, unsupported capability, and resource exhaustion where this Reference distinguishes them;
- avoid panic, memory unsafety, and process abort for accepted source and documented invalid-input paths.

It need not reproduce internal DAG layouts, solver traversal order, allocation counts, external
implementation enumeration order, or human-oriented whitespace unless a clause makes one observable.

### 0.5 Diagnostics, limits, and invalid input

**TNK-DOC-006 — Failure classification.** A public operation classifies failure at the narrowest owning boundary: lexical/parse, static declaration or statement, module/view composition, command construction, Unsupported capability, backend `Unknown`/`BadDag`, user bound, internal incompleteness, external I/O, or resource exhaustion. A diagnostic's category and documented state effect are semantic; incidental prose is not. Accepted input MUST NOT panic, abort the process, or cause memory unsafety.

Invalid module/view definitions are atomic unless a clause explicitly permits statement-local isolation. Invalid commands do not partially apply their requested semantic transition. Low-level Rust API precondition violations, such as using an engine-relative ID with another `Engine`, are programmer errors rather than accepted source input.

The current workspace does not satisfy this policy uniformly for incorrect input. Appendix H.4 is the release-specific exception ledger: it records what the implementation presently does, but does not make those inputs accepted language or relax the intended conformance rules.

**TNK-DOC-007 — Resource policy.** A user bound is a requested finite prefix, not a timeout and not proof of exhaustion. An implementation resource limit MUST be reported separately from no-solution. External harness timeouts and operating-system termination are outside TNK semantics.

### 0.6 Conformance profiles

**TNK-PROFILE-001 — Named profiles.** The **default** profile builds every workspace crate with default features and uses the pure-Rust null SMT backend, whose answer is `Unknown`. The **smt-z3** profile enables the crate feature `smt-z3` on `tnk-core` directly or through the forwarding feature on `tnk-session`/`tnk-repl`. There is no root workspace feature of that name.

Loaded hook libraries form runtime capability sets, not hidden language defaults. A clause guarded by “when hooks resolve” applies only after the defining module is loaded; the missing-hook behavior remains specified as Optional or Unsupported.

### 0.7 Product boundary

TNK comprises five layers:

| Crate | Responsibility | Public role |
|---|---|---|
| `tnk-core` | sorts, symbols, terms, matching, reduction, rewriting, search, symbolic solvers, GC | semantic kernel and low-level embedding API |
| `tnk-frontend` | lexer, module/command parser, mixfix grammar, term building, pretty-printing | source-language layer |
| `tnk-modules` | module/view databases, imports, renaming, instantiation, reflection descent | composition layer |
| `tnk-session` | persistent host-owned state, command execution, continuations, diagnostics | primary embedding boundary |
| `tnk-repl` | terminal wrapping, prompts, history, CLI policy | executable adapter |

**TNK-DOC-004 — No implicit stock prelude in libraries.** The kernel, frontend, module, and Session layers do not load `prelude.maude`. Only the `tnk-repl` binary attempts to load that external file. The sole in-process module synthesis is `CONFIGURATION`, inserted by `tnk_modules::prelude::ensure_builtins` when an object module/import needs it and no user definition exists. Every other library-defined semantic surface exists only after its module has been loaded.

### 0.8 Compact feature contract

Each normative feature is read through the same ten fields: **status** (the matrix in §23), **surface** (syntax/API block), **static requirements**, **meaning**, **observable contract**, **errors and recovery**, **completeness/resource boundary**, **unspecified behavior**, **minimal example**, and stable **`TNK-*` anchor**. Closely related clauses compress these fields into prose and tables rather than repeating ten headings; omission means “not applicable,” never “whatever the implementation happens to do.” Appendix L provides linkable anchors for every clause.

# Part I — Semantic foundations

## 1. Signatures, sorts, and kinds

### 1.1 Sort order

A TNK signature contains named sorts and a strict declared subsort relation. Its reflexive-transitive closure is written `<=`.

**TNK-SORT-001 — Partial order.** Distinct user sorts MUST NOT be mutually reachable through subsort declarations. A subsort cycle invalidates the signature. Reflexivity and transitivity are implicit; users do not declare them.

**TNK-SORT-002 — Kinds.** The undirected connected components of the subsort graph are kinds. Each kind has one synthesized error/top sort, written by the printer as a bracketed list of the component's maximal user sorts, for example `[Nat]` or `[Nat,Bool]`. Every user sort is below its kind error sort. Error sorts are not below user sorts.

A term has a **least sort**. If no operator declaration applies to the argument sorts, the application has the result kind's error sort rather than becoming an untyped node.

### 1.2 Operators and overloading

An operator declaration has a canonical name, arity, domain sorts, range sort, and attributes. Declarations with the same canonical name and the same domain-kind vector and result kind form one overload family (one semantic symbol).

**TNK-SORT-003 — Applicability and least result.** A declaration `f : S1 ... Sn -> S` is applicable to arguments of least sorts `A1 ... An` exactly when `Ai <= Si` for every position. The application's least sort is the greatest lower bound of applicable range sorts when unique. If incomparable applicable ranges have no unique least choice, TNK currently chooses the earliest declared applicable range and classifies the signature as non-preregular at that application. The choice is Stable for a fixed declaration order; warning presentation is not yet part of the contract.

**TNK-SORT-004 — Kind coherence.** One overload-family symbol has a fixed arity, one kind for every domain position, and one result kind. A shared source name with a different arity, domain-kind profile, or result kind denotes a separate semantic symbol.

**TNK-SORT-005 — Partial operators.** `~>` declares a partial operator. Its domain and range positions are lifted to their kinds. Inputs outside the intended user sorts may therefore build a kind-sorted unreduced application. Partiality does not synthesize an exception or an option value.

### 1.3 Variables and substitutions

A variable is identified by a written name, declared sort, and command- or statement-local slot. A colon variable such as `X:Nat` declares its sort at the occurrence. A bare variable must be declared by `var` or `vars` in its source scope.

**TNK-SORT-006 — Sort-respecting substitution.** A substitution may bind a variable of sort `S` only to a term whose least sort is `<= S`. Repeated occurrences of the same variable MUST receive equal values modulo the operator axioms and equations applicable at the operation's semantic boundary.

Variable slot numbers and internal fresh-family names are not semantic identities across independent commands. Printed fresh names are presentation unless an indexed metalevel API explicitly returns them.

## 2. Terms and equality

A term is a variable, an operator application, an iterated operator application, or a literal represented by a hooked operator. Runtime terms are DAGs: equal subterms may be shared, but sharing is not semantic.

### 2.1 Operator theories

TNK assigns one matching/canonicalization theory to an operator from its attributes:

| Attributes | Theory | Canonical meaning |
|---|---|---|
| none of `assoc`, `comm`, `id:`, `idem`, `iter` | Free | ordered fixed-arity application |
| `assoc` | AU/A | flattened ordered word, with optional identity removal |
| `assoc comm` | ACU/AC | flattened multiset, with optional identity removal |
| any non-associative combination of `comm`, `id:`, `idem` | CUI family | binary commutation and/or collapse laws |
| `iter` | S | compact repeated unary application |

**TNK-TERM-001 — Quotient equality.** Semantic equality of runtime terms is structural equality after canonicalization by the declared operator axioms. It ignores DAG sharing and allocation identity. User equations are not part of structural equality; they are part of reduction. Calling a reduced normal form “equal” therefore means both equation-normal and axiom-canonical only when the context says so.

**TNK-TERM-002 — Associativity.** An associative application is flattened without changing left-to-right argument order. For an associative-commutative application, arguments form a deterministic canonical multiset. The internal sort order of equal-kind elements is Implementation-defined; clients that need mathematical AC equality compare multisets or canonical terms.

**TNK-TERM-003 — Identities.** `id: e` is two-sided and participates in AU, ACU, and CUI construction and matching. On an associative operator, `left id: e` and `right id: e` collapse only the corresponding AU end. On a commutative operator a one-sided declaration becomes two-sided. A non-associative, non-commutative operator with only a one-sided identity remains a free binary constructor for ordinary construction/matching; no general CUI collapse is promised. Identity terms must be ground and sort-compatible.

**TNK-TERM-004 — Idempotence.** `[idem]` identifies `f(x,x)` with `x` at canonicalization and matching boundaries supported by the CUI matcher. Non-ground unification under an idempotent operator is Unsupported; ground terms still canonicalize.

**TNK-TERM-005 — Iteration.** `[iter]` is unary. `f^n(t)` denotes `n` applications without allocating an `n`-node chain. Iteration counts are arbitrary-precision positive decimal values at the source boundary. `f^0(t)` is represented semantically by `t`, not by an iter node.

### 2.2 Literals

The frontend can build literals only when the loaded signature supplies the corresponding hooked symbols.

- Natural and integer numerals use a zero/successor/minus hook family and arbitrary-precision values.
- Glued rationals such as `-7/3` are canonical exact rationals when a rational/division surface is loaded.
- Floats use IEEE 754 binary64 (`f64`).
- Strings are owned string values; quoted identifiers are interned identifier values.

**TNK-TERM-006 — Exact and inexact numbers.** Integer and rational equality, hashing, and ordering are mathematical and exact. Rational values are reduced to canonical form. Float operations follow the host's IEEE `f64` behavior; NaN and infinity behavior is therefore float behavior, not exact-number behavior.

### 2.3 Runtime handles and garbage collection

`DagId`, `SortId`, and `SymbolId` are engine-relative handles. They are not serializable semantic identifiers and MUST NOT cross engines.

**TNK-RUNTIME-001 — DAG lifetime.** A `DagId` remains usable across collection only while reachable from an engine root or a live `RootGuard`. `Engine::root(id)` returns the RAII guard. Dropping the guard releases the pin; `RootGuard::set` retargets it.

**TNK-RUNTIME-002 — Non-moving collection.** Collection is mark-and-sweep and does not move live nodes. Freed slots may be reused. Debug builds detect stale and cross-engine handles; release builds do not promise such detection. `contains` and `try_get` are not liveness proofs for unrooted handles across a collection.

**TNK-RUNTIME-003 — Semantic transparency.** Garbage collection MUST NOT change reduction, matching, search, solver, printing, or continuation results for properly rooted terms. GC timing, arena capacity, and node sharing are not observable semantics.

## 3. Equations, memberships, rules, and conditions

### 3.1 Statement classes

- `eq` and `ceq` define equational reduction.
- `mb` and `cmb` refine the least sort of matching terms.
- `rl` and `crl` define transition rules used by rewriting and search.
- `[nonexec]` retains a statement as specification metadata but excludes it from ordinary execution.
- `[variant]` makes an equation available to folding variant narrowing in addition to ordinary equational reduction.
- `[narrowing]` makes a rule available to variant-based narrowing. A rule may be both `[narrowing]` and `[nonexec]`: it then participates in narrowing but not ordinary rewriting.

Theory declarations retain statements as specification material. `[nonexec]` statements are proof obligations and do not execute; unmarked theory equations remain executable when a theory is built and reduced directly. Views still require a theory source.

### 3.2 Equational reduction

**TNK-REDUCE-001 — Normalization.** `reduce` repeatedly evaluates permitted arguments and applies successful hooked specials or executable equations until neither applies. A successful special or equation application counts as one rewrite. Its replacement is reduced under the same strategy until normal form.

**TNK-REDUCE-002 — Top-rewrite choice.** At one redex, an implemented `special` hook is attempted before user equations. If it declines, executable ordinary equations are tried in flattened declaration order. Each equation matcher may enumerate several substitutions; the first whose condition succeeds is used. `[owise]` equations are considered only after every ordinary equation and all condition solutions fail. The first applicable `[owise]` equation is used.

**TNK-REDUCE-003 — Evaluation strategy.** Operator `strat (...)` controls argument/top evaluation order using 1-based argument positions and `0` for a top-rewrite attempt. Without an explicit strategy TNK uses its standard eager strategy. `[frozen]` and `frozen (positions)` suppress rule-rewrite descent at the designated arguments; equations required to form canonical terms still govern reduction according to the operator strategy.

### 3.3 Membership evaluation

**TNK-MB-001 — Sort refinement.** A successful membership axiom lowers a node's least sort but does not replace its term. Only strict lowering counts. Memberships are retried to a fixpoint after each lowering.

**TNK-MB-002 — Priority.** Applicable memberships are considered by target specificity (smaller target sort first), with declaration order breaking equivalent choices. Each successful strict lowering counts as one rewrite. A failed match or condition has no membership count.

### 3.4 Conditions

A condition is a conjunction of fragments evaluated left-to-right:

| Form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `u = v` | instantiate and reduce both sides; require quotient-structural equality |
| `u : S` | instantiate and reduce `u`; require `least-sort(u) <= S` |
| `p := u` | reduce `u`, match `p`, and bind variables first introduced in `p` |
| `u => p` | in a `crl` only, breadth-first rewrite-search from `u` until `p` matches |
| `b` | abbreviated Boolean fragment; desugars to `b = true` using the loaded truth hook |

**TNK-COND-001 — Backtracking.** If a later fragment fails, evaluation resumes the nearest earlier multi-solution matching or rewrite fragment. It then propagates outward to the statement matcher. Bindings introduced on a failed branch MUST be rolled back.

**TNK-COND-002 — Variable discipline.** An equation or membership right side/target condition may use only variables bound by its left side or by earlier condition fragments. A rule may similarly introduce variables through earlier condition fragments; an executable statement with an unbound right-side variable is rejected. Rewrite fragments are legal only in rule conditions.

**TNK-COND-003 — Divergence.** Rewrite conditions can explore an unbounded state space and recursive conditions can diverge. TNK avoids process-stack overflow at the recursive condition seam, but it does not impose a semantic timeout and exposes no cooperative cancellation token.

### 3.5 Rules

**TNK-RULE-001 — Transition.** One rule transition selects a non-frozen position, matches one executable rule left side modulo the symbol theories, satisfies its condition, replaces the redex with the instantiated right side, and equationally reduces the resulting term where required by the driving command.

Rule transitions are distinct from equation normalization. `reduce` never applies rules. `rewrite`, `frewrite`, `erewrite`, ordinary `search`, strategies, LTL model checking, and some condition fragments do.

### 3.6 Semantic relations and environments

A flattened module environment is written

$$\mathcal{M}=(\Sigma,A,E,M,R,H),$$

where $\Sigma$ is the order-sorted signature, $A$ the declared structural axioms, $E$ executable equations, $M$ executable memberships, $R$ executable rules, and $H$ resolved hook metadata. Source imports, views, and renamings construct this environment; they are not extra rewrite steps inside it.

**TNK-SEM-001 — Core relations.** The Reference uses:

- $\Gamma \vdash t:s$ when $s$ is the least sort of term $t$ under variable environment $\Gamma$;
- $t =_A u$ when axiom-canonical forms of $t$ and $u$ are structurally equal;
- $t \rightarrow_{E/A} u$ for one permitted hooked/equational reduction step modulo $A$, and $\rightarrow^*_{E/A}$ for its reflexive-transitive closure;
- $t \Rightarrow_{R/E,A} u$ for one admissible rule transition modulo $A$, with the equation-normalization required by the driving command;
- $\sigma \models_A p \preceq t$ when sort-respecting substitution $\sigma$ makes pattern $p$ equal to subject $t$ modulo $A$;
- $\theta \models_A \{u_i =? v_i\}$ when every $u_i\theta =_A v_i\theta$;
- $t \Rightarrow^n u$ for reachability by exactly $n$ rule transitions between canonical states.

Matching does not include $E$ unless a command explicitly normalizes its boundary. Search nodes are equation-normal, so their equality is $=_{E/A}$ by normalizing both sides and then comparing modulo $A$. LTL satisfaction is over infinite paths of this canonical transition system; a deadlock receives only the semantic self-loop specified by `TNK-LTL-001`.

# Part II — Source language

## 4. Lexical syntax

### 4.1 Tokens

**TNK-LEX-001 — Token separation and terminators.** Whitespace and the characters `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`, and `,` separate tokens; each punctuation character is a token. Other characters, including `_`, `+`, `-`, `<`, `=`, `:`, and ordinary periods, may belong to an identifier. A backquote escapes a splitting character into the current identifier.

A `.` is a terminator when, after spaces/tabs/carriage returns, it is followed by end of input, newline, a `***`/`---` line-comment marker, or a keyword in the release's same-line **SEEN_DOT** set:

```text
fmod mod fth th endfm endm endfth endth view endv
sort sorts subsort subsorts op ops var vars
protecting pr extending ex including inc
eq ceq mb cmb rl crl
red reduce check match xmatch rew rewrite search smt-search
```

Otherwise `.` remains an identifier character, including the `_._` operator. Same-line separation before a top-level opener absent from this list is Implementation-defined recovery; portable source puts a newline after the terminator.

**TNK-LEX-002 — Comments.** `***` and `---` begin line comments. If the first nonblank character after either marker is `(`, it begins a balanced parenthesized comment that may cross lines; backquoted parentheses do not affect its balance. Comments produce no tokens.

**TNK-LEX-003 — Literal tokens.** The lexer recognizes:

- naturals: `0` or a nonzero digit followed by digits;
- negative integers: a glued `-` and decimal digits with nonzero magnitude (`-0` is not a negative-integer token);
- rationals: `[ - ] num/den` with no spaces, canonical leading-zero rules, and a positive nonzero denominator; `-0/n`, `00/n`, and `n/0` are not rational tokens;
- floats with optional sign, at least one digit, and a decimal point or exponent, plus signed `Infinity`; examples include `+1.5`, `1.`, `.5`, `1e3`, `.5e2`, and `-Infinity`;
- strings only when an unescaped closing quote is the token's final character; a glued `"x"y` is an identifier;
- quoted identifiers beginning with `'`;
- iter tokens whose last suffix is `^` plus a positive, leading-nonzero decimal count.

Spacing is semantic at tokenization: `1/6` is a rational token while `1 / 6` is an operator application; `-7` is one integer token while `- 7` uses an operator token; `5 -7` is not the same token stream as `5 - 7`.

### 4.2 Term grammar

TNK constructs a per-module context-free grammar from sort and operator declarations.

**TNK-PARSE-001 — Mixfix holes.** Each `_` in an operator name is an argument hole. A valid declaration has exactly as many holes as its declared arity. Literal fragments, precedence, and gather annotations determine admissible parses. Prefix operators and constants use their declared spelling. Parentheses group terms. `(t).Sort` explicitly disambiguates an overloaded term at a sort. The current fallback for an invalid hole/arity mismatch is catalogued in Appendix H.4.

`prec n` assigns precedence. `gather (E e & ...)` constrains each hole (`E` strong, `e` weak, `&` unconstrained). If omitted, TNK derives defaults from fixity and precedence.

**TNK-PARSE-002 — Parse outcomes.** Statement terms and membership target sorts require one parse. Unique parse is also required for a `match`/`xmatch` pattern, a search goal, and an `srewrite`/`dsrewrite` subject. The current command surface selects the first packed-forest parse for reduce/check/rewrite/frewrite/erewrite subjects, match subjects, search subjects, unification pairs, variant terms/blockers, and narrowing subject/goal terms. The selected first-parse order is Implementation-defined; portable source disambiguates it.

No parse rejects the owning statement or command under the intended parser contract. Ambiguity rejects only the bubbles listed as unique-parse above. Statement-local rejection follows `TNK-STMT-001`; command rejection follows the Session transition table. Current invalid-input exceptions, including skipped top-level tokens and nonuniform trailing-attribute handling, are catalogued in Appendix H.4.

**TNK-PARSE-003 — Resource bound.** Production parsing uses a deterministic effort limit of `100,000,000` parser work units. Exceeding it is resource exhaustion, not a malformed-term result. The diagnostic identifies the furthest token. The limit is Stable until an explicit Reference revision changes it.

The generated grammar does not provide redundant hole-bearing prefix spellings such as `_+_(a,b)` or `s_(t)`. Use the declared mixfix form or declare a separate prefix operator.

## 5. Modules, theories, and declarations

### 5.1 Module forms

The accepted open/close pairs are:

| Form | Meaning | Close |
|---|---|---|
| `fmod M is ... endfm` | functional module; equations and memberships | `endfm` |
| `mod M is ... endm` | system module; additionally rules | `endm` |
| `fth T is ... endfth` | functional theory; statements may be executable unless `[nonexec]` | `endfth` |
| `th T is ... endth` | system theory; rules allowed as specification or execution according to attributes | `endth` |
| `smod M is ... endsm` | strategy system module | `endsm` |
| `sth T is ... endsth` | strategy system theory | `endsth` |
| `omod M is ... endom` | object-oriented system module | `endom` |
| `oth T is ... endoth` | object-oriented system theory | `endoth` |

A parameterized declaration inserts `{ X :: THEORY, ... }` after the module or view name; `::` is one token.

**TNK-MOD-001 — Functional/system gate.** Functional modules and theories reject rules. Strategy declarations/definitions are accepted only in strategy modules/theories. Object declarations are accepted only in object modules/theories.

### 5.2 Declaration grammar

The declaration surface is:

```text
SortName  ::= Id | SortName "{" SortName ("," SortName)* "}"
            | "[" SortName ("," SortName)* "]"

sort SortName .
sorts SortName+ .
subsort SortName < SortName .
subsorts SortName+ ("<" SortName+)+ .

op  OpName : SortName* ("->" | "~>") SortName [OpAttrs] .
ops OpName+ : SortName* ("->" | "~>") SortName [OpAttrs] .
var  Name : SortName .
vars Name+ : SortName .

protecting ModuleExpr .
extending  ModuleExpr .
including  ModuleExpr .
generated-by ModuleExpr .

class Cid [ "|" AttrName ":" SortName ("," AttrName ":" SortName)* ] .
classes ...
subclass Cid+ "<" Cid+ ("<" Cid+)* .
subclasses ...
msg OpName : SortName* "->" SortName [OpAttrs] .
msgs ...

strat Name+ [ ":" SortName* ] "@" SortName .
strats ...
sd  Name [ "(" TermBubble ("," TermBubble)* ")" ] ":=" Strategy .
csd Name [ "(" TermBubble ("," TermBubble)* ")" ] ":=" Strategy "if" Condition .
```

`pr`, `ex`, and `inc` abbreviate the three ordinary import modes. `generated-by` is accepted as a protecting-equivalent donation form; because import-mode obligations are Experimental, reflected mode-tag distinctions for this spelling are not portable. `class`/`subclass`/`msg` are object-only; `strat`/`sd`/`csd` are strategy-only. `csd` parses but is Unsupported at strategy resolution.

A user sort identifier cannot contain `.`. Bracketed sort names denote kinds; structured sorts and parameter sorts such as `List{Nat}` and `X$Elt` are semantic names, not punctuation-free aliases.

### 5.3 Operator attributes

| Attribute | TNK behavior |
|---|---|
| `assoc`, `comm`, `idem` | select algebraic canonicalization and matching laws |
| `id: t`, `left id: t`, `right id: t` | two- or one-sided identity |
| `iter` | compact iteration theory |
| `ctor` | constructor metadata used by symbolic analyses; no direct rewrite |
| `prec n`, `gather (...)` | grammar |
| `strat (...)` | equational evaluation strategy |
| `frozen`, `frozen (...)` | rule/narrowing descent barrier |
| `format (...)` | pretty-printer layout controls |
| `poly (...)` | expand listed argument/range positions (`1..n`, range `0`) over each kind |
| `special (...)` | bind an implemented built-in hook |
| `config`, `obj`, `msg`, `portal` and long aliases | object/external scheduler roles |
| `pconst` | parameter-theory constant, mapped through views |
| `ditto` | inherit the preceding declaration's attributes where valid |
| `metadata`, `latex`, `rpo` | accepted non-semantic metadata/termination hints |
| `memo` | Unsupported: accepted, warned about, and has no execution effect |

**TNK-DECL-001 — Unknown attributes and hooks.** An unknown operator attribute or unknown `special` subdirective is rejected. A recognized `id-hook` class with no TNK implementation attaches no `SpecialOp`; the operator remains ordinary and may still reduce by user equations. This Unsupported binding is currently silent at build time, so an unchanged term is not evidence that the hook ran.

`special` accepts `id-hook CLASS (...)`, `op-hook PURPOSE (...)`, and `term-hook PURPOSE (...)`. Hook names are library integration interfaces. §16.1 and Appendix G classify the supported classes.

### 5.4 Statements

```text
[Label] ":" eq  lhs = rhs [StmtAttrs] .
[Label] ":" ceq lhs = rhs if Condition [StmtAttrs] .
[Label] ":" mb  term : SortName [StmtAttrs] .
[Label] ":" cmb term : SortName if Condition [StmtAttrs] .
[Label] ":" rl  lhs => rhs [StmtAttrs] .
[Label] ":" crl lhs => rhs if Condition [StmtAttrs] .
```

The leading `[Label] :` is optional for every statement family. For rules, the familiar `rl [Label] : ...` token arrangement is accepted by the same label peeling. Retained execution attributes are `owise`, `variant`, `nonexec`, `narrowing`, and `label Name`; `print` is retained for validation/trace presentation. `metadata`, `format`, and `dnt` are parsed but semantically ignored. Unknown trailing statement-attribute tokens do not have one uniform current treatment; Appendix H.4 records the parser-path-dependent behavior. Portable source uses only the listed attributes.

`Condition` is a `/\`-separated conjunction of the fragments in §3.4; `\/` is not a statement-condition connective.

**TNK-STMT-001 — Invalid statement isolation.** Under the intended statement boundary, a statement whose terms, variable discipline, print metadata, or supported condition forms are invalid is dropped with a diagnostic when the enclosing module can otherwise be built. Dropping one statement MUST NOT shift the source identity of later executable statements or corrupt reflection metadata. Appendix H.4 records current invalid-input seams that silently retain a statement or otherwise differ from this rule.

### 5.5 Views

A view has the form:

```text
view V { P :: T, ... } from ModuleExpr to ModuleExpr is
  sort S to T .
  op f to g .
  op f : A B ("->" | "~>") C to g .
  op c to term TargetTerm .
  var X : S .
  class C to D .
  attr a [ "." Class ] to b .
  msg SourceBubble to term TargetTerm .
endv
```

**TNK-VIEW-001 — View validity.** The source must be a named theory or an instantiation rooted at one; source and target cannot be sums or renamings. Source sorts map explicitly or by identity. For an unparameterized view with a plain named target, install-time validation checks target sort existence, kind preservation, and a compatible operator or operator-to-term image for every source profile. Invalid views are not installed.

Parameterized views and views with a nontrivial instantiated target receive partial install-time checks; remaining homomorphism obligations are discharged when instantiated. A partially validated stored view is not evidence that every future instantiation is valid. View variables scope only operator-to-term/message mappings.

## 6. Module expressions and composition

The complete shape is:

```text
ModuleExpr ::= Rename ("+" Rename)*
Rename     ::= Atom ("*" "(" RenameItem ("," RenameItem)* ")")*
Atom       ::= Name | "(" ModuleExpr ")" | Atom "{" ModuleExpr ("," ModuleExpr)* "}"
RenameItem ::= "sort"  SortName "to" SortName

```

Instantiation arguments are a view name, a parameterized-view instantiation, or an enclosing formal parameter name. Bare modules, sums, and renamings are not legal arguments; define an identity view when a module is the intended target.

**TNK-MOD-002 — Flattening and order.** Declaration donation is depth-first, imports before importer. The root module's own statements and strategy declarations/definitions are then moved before imported ones; imported blocks retain post-order. Each canonical module expression contributes at most once, so diamonds do not duplicate a common base. Sort and variable names are name-deduplicated; ops, subsorts, and statements are appended. Strategy declarations/definitions carry origin and source index so the strategy compiler deduplicates diamond donation without merging independent text-identical definitions. Statement home modules are build-time reparse data, not reflected statement metadata.

**TNK-MOD-003 — Import modes.** `protecting`, `extending`, and `including` donate the same closure. Their source mode remains available to reflection, but a flattened executable image has no import list and TNK enforces no no-junk/no-confusion obligations. The semantic mode distinction is Experimental.

**TNK-MOD-004 — Parameters.** A formal parameter copies only sorts declared by its bounding theory under `X$`; sorts donated to that theory by ordinary modules remain shared. `[pconst]` operators receive corresponding parameter names and map through views. Structured sort parameters substitute structurally (`Base{X}` to `Base{Arg}`), including chained instances. A theory-target view can deliberately leave a parameter free for a later instantiation; importing an instance that still has free parameters is an error. An apparent `X$Name` not owned by the bound theory is not rewritten merely because of its spelling.

**TNK-MOD-005 — Renaming.** Sort, operator, label, class, attribute, and message renamings apply structurally. An operator profile selects an overload; without one the name map applies to every matching declaration. Optional target attributes override the renamed operator attributes. Mixfix applications, special hook references, identity/term-hook bubbles, and required sort qualification are reconstructed structurally rather than by blind text replacement. Strategy names themselves are not ordinary operator renames.

**TNK-MOD-006 — Atomic definition.** A successful module definition makes that module current, clears reflection state, drops the continuation, and rebuilds transitive dependents. A successful view definition leaves the current module unchanged; it rebuilds dependent modules and drops the continuation iff a module was rebuilt. A failed module/view definition preserves the prior database, built dependents, current selection, and continuation.

**TNK-MOD-007 — Import hygiene.** Self/mutually recursive imports and closed-module imports that retain free parameters are hard flattening errors. A non-theory module silently ignores an ordinary import of a theory; a non-strategy module silently ignores an imported strategy module. These silent skips are specified recovery, not successful donation. Parameter bounds are not ordinary imports.

# Part III — Commands and evaluation

## 7. Common command rules

Most semantic commands accept an optional `in M :` qualifier. It selects module `M` for that command only and does not change the Session's current module.

Supported bracketed bounds use positive decimal components:

- `[n]` limits results or rule applications as described by the command;
- `[n,m]` supplies the command-specific second bound;
- a `0` component in a bracketed bound is rejected with a parse-category diagnostic for rewrite, frewrite, erewrite, search, SMT-search, variants, variant unification/matching, and narrowing;
- ordinary `unify [0]` is a known unsupported parser/driver edge: it currently prints `No unifier.` and MUST NOT be used as a semantic query;
- `continue 0 .` is valid and performs no additional work.

**TNK-CMD-001 — Bounds and completion.** Reaching a user bound is not semantic exhaustion. A bounded command MUST retain a continuation when its command class is resumable and MUST NOT print an exhaustion claim merely because the bound was reached. Exhaustion means the underlying finite enumerator or state space has been explored to its defined boundary.

**TNK-CMD-002 — Result order.** TNK guarantees equation/rule declaration priority, breadth-first search depth, fair-vs-depth-first strategy policy, and source-order state effects. Tie order among independent equal-depth matches, AC partitions, unifiers, or graph successors is deterministic within one run but otherwise Implementation-defined unless an indexed API clause says otherwise. A bounded command returns a deterministic prefix; callers that need an unordered mathematical result compare canonical sets and reject duplicates.

The command surface and saved-operation behavior are:

| Command family | First bound | Second bound | Saves a continuation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rewrite` | rule applications | — | yes |
| `frewrite` | rule applications | per-position gas | yes |
| `erewrite` | configuration deliveries | fallback gas | yes |
| `search` | solutions | rule depth | yes |
| `smt-search` | solutions | rule depth | yes, except Unsupported `=>!` |
| `get variants` | variants | — | yes |
| `variant unify` / `variant match` | results | — | yes |
| `vu-narrow` / `fvu-narrow` | solutions | narrowing depth | yes |
| `reduce`, `check`, `match`, `xmatch`, strategy rewrite, ordinary `unify` | command-specific eager result | — | no |

Ordinary unification is currently eager and not resumable. A bound limits only the results rendered by that command.

## 8. Reduction and matching

### 8.1 Reduce

```text
reduce [in M :] term .
red    [in M :] term .
```

**TNK-CMD-REDUCE-001 — Reduce result.** The operand is built, equationally normalized, assigned its final least sort, and printed as `result SORT: TERM`. Open variables in a command subject are treated as stable symbolic constants for reduction, not as existential matcher variables. The command reports the aggregate rewrite count for that evaluation.

### 8.2 Match and extension match

```text
match  [in M :] pattern <=? subject .
xmatch [in M :] pattern <=? subject .
```

**TNK-MATCH-001 — Whole matching.** `match` enumerates sort-correct substitutions under which the pattern equals the whole subject modulo declared operator axioms. It does not use user equations to discover a binding, except for reductions explicitly performed while building/evaluating the command boundary.

**TNK-MATCH-002 — Extension matching.** `xmatch` permits a theory-rooted pattern to match a proper associative/AC portion where that theory defines extension. A result includes the matched portion/residue distinction in the command presentation. Without extension, an unmatched residue makes the candidate fail.

**TNK-MATCH-003 — Enumeration.** Every returned substitution is sound, duplicate-free under semantic substitution equality, and sort-correct. For a finite matcher, unbounded enumeration is complete. Enumeration order is Implementation-defined.

## 9. Rewriting modes

### 9.1 Rule-fair rewriting

```text
rewrite [n] [in M :] term .
rew     [n] [in M :] term .
```

**TNK-REWRITE-001 — Rule-fair mode.** The session first equationally normalizes the current term, then applies one rule at the first top-down non-frozen redex admitted by the rule scheduler. Per-symbol rule cursors rotate after success so repeated applications do not permanently starve later rules. It repeats until no rule applies or `n` rule applications have occurred.

The bound counts rule applications, not equation, condition, membership, or built-in rewrites. Those operations still contribute to the aggregate `rewrites:` diagnostic.

### 9.2 Position-fair rewriting

```text
frewrite [n]     [in M :] term .
frewrite [n,gas] [in M :] term .
frew     ...
```

**TNK-REWRITE-002 — Position-fair mode.** `frewrite` traverses non-frozen positions in repeated passes and allows at most `gas` successful rule applications at each position per pass. Default `gas` is `1`. The first bound limits total rule applications. A bounded stop may leave a noncanonical intermediate whose least sort has not been recalculated; it is reported as `result (sort not calculated)`.

### 9.3 Object/message rewriting

```text
erewrite [n]     [in M :] configuration .
erewrite [n,gas] [in M :] configuration .
erew ...
```

**TNK-REWRITE-003 — External/object mode.** At a symbol marked `config`, `erewrite` delivers queued messages object-by-object, respecting object, message, portal, and external-manager roles. At a non-configuration node it falls back to position-fair rewriting with the supplied gas. The first bound caps configuration-level deliveries.

External requests are synchronous. An accepted request is consumed and its response is inserted; a rejected request remains in the configuration. A stale external request token cannot consume a pending request. Standard stream managers support `write` to captured stdout/stderr and `getLine` from the Session's scripted input buffer.

### 9.4 Continue

```text
continue .
continue n .
cont ...
```

**TNK-CONT-001 — Continuations.** A Session owns at most one last continuation. `continue` resumes the saved rewrite, search, SMT-search, variant, variant-unifier/matcher, or narrowing object with its graph, solver, roots, counters, and numbering intact. A continuation is usable only while its originating module remains current and unchanged. `select`, including selection of the already-current name, always clears it. A successful module redefinition clears it; a successful view definition clears it only when dependent modules were rebuilt.

For rewrite sessions, an omitted continuation bound runs to rule normal form; a numeric bound permits that many additional rule applications. For enumerators, a numeric bound emits at most that many additional results; an omitted bound emits until exhaustion or divergence.

Continuation invalidation on a failed replacement command is currently Experimental and command-family-dependent: some builders clear before validation while others replace only on success. Portable hosts MUST NOT attempt `continue` after any intervening execution command, successful or failed. This boundary should become a uniform typed Session transition before continuation behavior is promoted beyond the current command contract.

## 10. Reachability search

```text
search [n]   [in M :] initial ARROW goal [such that condition] .
search [n,m] [in M :] initial ARROW goal [such that condition] .
```

`ARROW` is one of:

| Arrow | Candidate depths |
|---|---|
| `=>1` | exactly one rule transition |
| `=>+` | one or more transitions |
| `=>*` | zero or more transitions; initial state is eligible |
| `=>!` | terminal states with no successors |

The first bound limits solutions and the second bounds rule-transition depth.

**TNK-SEARCH-001 — Graph.** Search equationally normalizes each state and interns semantically equal states into one graph node. It explores lazily in breadth-first discovery order. Distinct paths to an equal canonical state do not create duplicate states; all discovered rule labels reaching a forward arc remain available for graph inspection.

**TNK-SEARCH-002 — Results.** A state is a solution when its depth satisfies the arrow, the goal matches, and `such that` succeeds. Search is sound and duplicate-state-free. In a finite graph with no depth bound it is complete. In an infinite graph an unbounded search may not terminate. Solution depths are nondecreasing; ordering within one depth is Implementation-defined.

**TNK-SEARCH-003 — Counts and paths.** Each solution reports its graph state, discovered-state count, and rewrite-count snapshot after its condition succeeds. `show path N .` follows the stored BFS predecessor tree. `show search graph .` reports discovered nodes and known arcs; because expansion is lazy, a bounded search may expose only a prefix of the reachable graph.

## 11. Strategies

```text
srewrite  [in M :] term using Strategy .
srew      [in M :] term using Strategy .
dsrewrite [in M :] term using Strategy .
dsrew     [in M :] term using Strategy .
```

Strategy precedence from low to high is branch `? :`, union `|`, sequence `;`, postfix `* + !`, then atoms:

```text
Strategy ::= Strategy "?" Strategy ":" Strategy
           | Strategy "|" Strategy
           | Strategy ";" Strategy
           | Strategy ("*" | "+" | "!")*
           | "(" Strategy ")"
           | "idle" | "fail" | "all"
           | ("top" | "one" | "try" | "not" | "test") "(" Strategy ")"
           | "or-else" "(" Strategy "," Strategy ")"
           | ("match" | "xmatch" | "amatch") Pattern
               [ "such" "that" Condition ]
           | ("matchrew" | "xmatchrew" | "amatchrew") Pattern
               [ "such" "that" Condition ]
               "by" Var "using" Strategy
               ("," Var "using" Strategy)*
           | Label [ "[" Var "<-" Term ("," Var "<-" Term)* "]" ]
               [ "{" Strategy ("," Strategy)* "}" ]
           | StrategyName [ "(" Term ("," Term)* ")" ]
```

`idle` succeeds unchanged; `fail` has no result; `all` applies every applicable rule at the current strategy seam. A label application may carry an initial substitution and one condition substrategy per rewrite-condition fragment. A named call resolves an `sd` whose declaration profile and left pattern match its arguments.

**TNK-STRAT-001 — Scheduling.** `srewrite` schedules processes FIFO and interleaves child tasks fairly. `dsrewrite` schedules depth-first. A process with no pending strategy emits one solution. `one(E)` emits at most the first `E` solution; `E!` continues until `E` fails and then emits the normal form.

**TNK-STRAT-002 — Branching.** `T ? S : F` runs `S` on every solution of `T`; if `T` has none it runs `F` on the original subject. Derived branch forms desugar to this rule. `matchrew` evaluates the named subterm strategies and rebuilds the enclosing match for their result combinations.

**TNK-STRAT-003 — Unsupported forms.** `xmatchrew` and conditional strategy definitions (`csd`) parse but are rejected during strategy resolution. Unconditional `sd` is Stable. `xmatch` as a strategy test is supported even though `xmatchrew` is not.

Strategy result values and fair/depth-first reachability are semantic. Aggregate rewrite-count interleaving among unequal-depth parallel branches is diagnostic and not a cross-release contract.

## 12. Order-sorted unification

```text
unify [n] [in M :] u =? v [ /\ u2 =? v2 ... ] .
irredundant unify [n] [in M :] ... .
irred unify ...
```

**TNK-UNIFY-001 — Meaning.** A result is a sort-correct substitution that makes every `=?` pair equal modulo declared algebraic axioms. Multiple `/\`-joined pairs are solved simultaneously. Free variables introduced by the solver receive sort-constrained fresh names. Every returned unifier is sound.

**TNK-UNIFY-002 — Supported theories.** Non-ground unification supports free and iteration operators, commutative/identity CUI combinations without idempotence, AC/ACU, and associative/AU word theories. It combines theory solved forms with maximal order-sorted assignments. ACU solving is finitary. AU solving may discover an infinite family or reach a bounded nonlinear exploration, in which case the low-level problem is incomplete.

**TNK-UNIFY-003 — Unsupported theories.** A non-ground subterm under an idempotent CUI operator or under an associative operator with a one-sided identity is an Unsupported unification problem. The low-level `UnifyProblem` marks `problem_okay = false` and yields no ordinary stream. Ground terms under those operators remain comparable/canonicalizable.

**TNK-UNIFY-004 — Completion.** Low-level finite exhaustion with `is_incomplete() == false` means the returned set is complete for the implemented theories. `is_incomplete() == true` means returned unifiers remain sound but completeness is not claimed. “No unifier,” “unsupported theory,” and “incomplete exploration” are distinct semantic outcomes.

The object-level Session renderer does not currently expose `UnifyProblem::is_incomplete`, unsupported-theory readiness, or a completion marker and is therefore an Experimental presentation boundary for completeness-sensitive clients. An unsupported ordinary unification command can produce only its command echo, as recorded in Appendix H.4. The Session also does not save an ordinary-unification continuation. Use the low-level API when the distinction is required.

`irredundant unify` filters the collected stream to a minimal complete set under substitution instantiation. Result order and fresh-variable spelling are Implementation-defined.

## 13. Variants and narrowing

### 13.1 Folding variants

```text
get variants [n] [in M :] term [such that B1, ... irreducible] .
get irredundant variants [n] [in M :] term [such that ... irreducible] .
```

**TNK-VARIANT-001 — Variant meaning.** A variant consists of an equation-normal form and the accumulated substitution for the original variables, generated by narrowing with executable `[variant]` equations modulo operator axioms. The initial renamed/reduced term is the first incremental variant. Folding removes states subsumed by retained variants.

Incremental mode exposes completed layers as they become available. Irredundant mode computes to exhaustion before exposing the final surviving set. The latter may therefore fail to return a first result on a nonterminating variant theory.

**TNK-VARIANT-002 — Irreducibility blockers.** Every `such that ... irreducible` term is normalized and must not be reducible by a variant equation. A reducible blocker rejects the query. Blockers constrain generated unifiers; they are not post-hoc text filters.

### 13.2 Variant unification and matching

```text
variant unify [n] [in M :] u =? v [ /\ ... ] [such that ... irreducible] .
filtered variant unify [n] [in M :] ... .
variant match [n] [in M :] pattern <=? subject [such that ... irreducible] .
```

**TNK-VARIANT-003 — Variant unification.** Variant unification completes simultaneous unification over generated variants. `filtered` computes the retained non-subsumed result set before presentation; plain mode may stream results. Returned unifiers are sound. A final completeness claim requires both variant exploration and all nested unifiers to exhaust without an incomplete flag.

**TNK-VARIANT-004 — Variant matching.** Variant matching treats variables in the subject as distinct symbolic constants while solving, then restores them in returned bindings. The Session saves the same variant-unifier stream as a continuation with `matching = true`. Matchers are filtered through the same variant-instance relation when requested by the operation.

### 13.3 Variant-based narrowing

```text
[{fold|vfold|path}, ...] vu-narrow [{filter|delay}, ...]
  [n] or [n,m] [in M :] initial ARROW goal [such that condition] .

fvu-narrow ...
```

`fvu-narrow` implies fold mode. Prefix options select state folding and retained path data; the post-command option block selects unifier filtering and delayed filtering.

**TNK-NARROW-001 — Narrowing graph.** Narrowing uses rules marked `[narrowing]`, including such rules marked `[nonexec]`. Conditional narrowing rules are Unsupported. In the current loader, such a rule is diagnosed and dropped as one invalid statement while the enclosing module and later valid statements are retained; Appendix H.4 records the exact recovery boundary. Narrowing explores non-variable, non-frozen positions and composes rule unifiers with each state's accumulated substitution.

**TNK-NARROW-002 — Search options.** `fold` removes states matched by retained states. `vfold` uses variant subsumption. `filter` retains most-general unifiers; `delay` defers that filtering as defined by the search. `path` retains step substitutions and rule/position records for `show path`. `=>1`, `=>+`, `=>*`, and `=>!` have the same depth qualification as ordinary search; the second bound is narrowing depth.

**TNK-NARROW-003 — Outcomes.** Returned narrowing solutions are sound and include the accumulated original-variable substitution. Finite exhaustion is complete only if no nested unification/variant solver reported incompleteness and no user depth bound truncated exploration.

Inspection commands for the last narrowing search are `show frontier states .`, `show most general states .`, `show path N .`, and `show path states N .`.

## 14. SMT-constrained operations

### 14.1 Build profiles

The `smt-z3` feature on `tnk-core`, forwarded by same-named features on `tnk-session` and `tnk-repl`, selects the native Z3 backend. The default build uses a null backend. At workspace scope, `--all-features` enables the per-crate features; there is no root package feature.

**TNK-SMT-001 — Optional backend.** With `smt-z3`, a well-formed supported SMT formula returns `Sat`, `Unsat`, `Unknown`, or `BadDag` according to translation and solver outcome. Without it, SMT checks return `Unknown`; they MUST NOT pretend satisfiability or unsatisfiability. Push, pop, and clear remain safe no-ops on the null backend. Merely compiling the feature is not evidence that a provisioned Z3 backend solved a query.

### 14.2 Check and SMT search

```text
check [in M :] formula .
smt-search [n] or [n,m] [in M :] initial ARROW goal [such that constraint] .
```

**TNK-SMT-002 — Formula surface.** SMT sorts and operators exist only when resolved from loaded hooks. TNK supports Boolean, integer, and real SMT values; Boolean connectives; arithmetic; comparisons; divisibility; integer tests; and the hook-defined conversions represented by the SMT operator catalogue. Unsupported operator/arity bindings reject the hook at build time.

**TNK-SMT-003 — SMT search.** SMT search carries an accumulated constraint with each rewrite state. A successor or goal match is retained only when the selected backend returns `Sat` for its constraint; `Unsat`, `Unknown`, and `BadDag` are all pruned, but only `Unsat` proves impossibility. Goal matching adds its constraint and returns the symbolic state, non-SMT bindings, and final `where` formula. It supports `=>1`, `=>+`, and `=>*`; `=>!` is Unsupported. Completeness therefore requires a backend that decides every encountered constraint; the default null backend cannot establish constrained reachability.

A `Sat`/`Unsat` answer is semantic. `Unknown` is not `Sat`, and a malformed/untranslatable DAG is not `Unsat`.

## 15. LTL and variant satisfiability

### 15.1 LTL

LTL model checking and LTL satisfiability are hooked operators supplied by a loaded library surface (normally `model-checker.maude`). They are not standalone parser commands.

**TNK-LTL-001 — Model checking.** The model checker builds the ordinary reduced rewrite graph lazily and checks the synchronous product with the negated property using nested DFS. A deadlock state has a self-loop for LTL semantics only; ordinary `search` still reports it as terminal. A counterexample records a finite lead-in and accepting cycle in the result representation supplied by the loaded hooks.

**TNK-LTL-002 — Formula semantics.** Supported formulas include propositions, Boolean connectives, next, until, and release; derived temporal operators are reduced through the loaded formula equations/hooks. Formula construction and automata simplification must preserve the accepted infinite-word language. Exact internal VWAA/Büchi state numbers, BDD variable numbers, and automaton dumps are not public contracts.

**TNK-LTL-003 — Termination.** Finite reachable graphs yield a decision. Infinite-state rewriting may make model checking diverge; there is no implicit cutoff.

### 15.2 Variant satisfiability

The TNK-authored `share/tnk/variant-satisfiability.maude` facade exposes native variant satisfiability.

**TNK-VSAT-001 — Decision domain.** Variant satisfiability is a separate procedure from SMT. It decides supported formulas over FVP, OS-compact constructor theories using constructor analysis, folding variants, and order-sorted unification. Eligibility rejection is distinct from `Sat` and `Unsat`. Explicit sort overrides may resolve identity-classification cases where inference is insufficient.

## 16. Built-ins, reflection, and objects

### 16.1 Built-in classes

When the loaded signature supplies valid hooks, TNK implements these classes:

- structural equality and initial/decomposing equality;
- lazy branch/conditional selection;
- arbitrary-precision natural/integer arithmetic, bit operations, comparisons, gcd/lcm/min/max, division and rational canonicalization;
- deterministic MT19937 `random(n)` seeded with zero;
- the per-rewrite-command stateful `counter` special;
- string concatenation, indexing/search, conversion, case, trim, comparison, and ASCII/C-locale character predicates;
- IEEE float arithmetic, common elementary functions, comparison, and numeric/string conversions;
- quoted-identifier/string conversion;
- SMT, LTL model checking, LTL satisfiability;
- META-LEVEL and LEXICAL descent operations listed below;
- local meta-interpreter and standard-stream external managers.

**TNK-BUILTIN-001 — Fallthrough.** A partial built-in applied outside its domain does not invent a value. It remains unreduced or falls through to user equations as appropriate. Division by zero, invalid character conversion, malformed Qid conversion, and negative results in a natural-only family follow this rule unless the loaded source defines an equation for them.

`counter` is inert under `reduce`; during `rewrite`/`frewrite` it yields `0,1,2,...` and resets for each new top-level rewriting command, not for `continue`.

### 16.2 Reflection

The reflection layer supports native descent for reduction/normalization, rewrite/frewrite/apply/xapply, match/xmatch, search/path, SMT check/search, sort queries, parsing/printing, well-formedness, up/down term and module/view components, unification, variants, variant matching, narrowing, strategy rewrite, and LEXICAL tokenize/printTokens when their hook signatures resolve.

**TNK-META-001 — Owned boundary.** Reflected module/term values are translated at the module/session boundary. Engine-local IDs never cross a child-interpreter or external-manager boundary. A metalevel operation whose `MetaOp` is `Unknown`, whose reflected value is malformed, or whose required hook cannot resolve remains inert or returns the loaded facade's explicit failure value; it MUST NOT dispatch to an unrelated operation.

**TNK-META-002 — Current limitations.** Conditional `metaMatch` constraints are Unsupported. The separately recognized state-only `metaNarrow2` path is inert. General up-mapping of some flat modules containing special/poly declarations may remain deferred; named-module facade requests are handled directly where specified by the loaded meta-interpreter surface.

### 16.3 Object modules and local interpreters

Object module `class`, `subclass`, and `msg` declarations are desugared to ordinary signature declarations; `CONFIGURATION` is imported implicitly. Object patterns are completed with an attribute-set variable, and class constants in patterns are generalized to class-sorted variables.

**TNK-OO-001 — Local interpreter isolation.** A local interpreter is an independent child `Session` owned by its parent. Its module/current/continuation state does not alias the parent. Requests and replies use owned reflected envelopes. Create, operation, and quit are synchronous; malformed or invalidated target traffic is rejected without consuming the request.

---

# Part IV — Session, presentation, and CLI

## 17. Session state machine

`tnk_session::Session` is the primary host API. `Session::eval(input, color)` synchronously evaluates one submission and returns:

```rust
pub struct Eval {
    pub output: String,
    pub exit: bool,
}
```

`Eval` is a presentation result, not a typed semantic event stream. It has no structured diagnostic, completion, unsupported, or resource-exhaustion field.

**TNK-SESSION-001 — Persistence.** A Session persistently owns its interner, parsed and built module/view databases, current module, settings, reflection caches, local interpreters, loaded-file set, and at most one continuation. Independent Session values share no semantic state.

**TNK-SESSION-002 — Submission boundary.** A submission may contain several complete top-level statements on separate physical lines. Definitions and commands run in source order. Two commands on one physical line are parsed as one invalid command submission. A module/view followed by commands on later lines is permitted. Output blocks are joined by a single newline and the final output has no trailing newline.

**TNK-SESSION-003 — Completeness probe.** `input_complete` returns true for a complete module/view terminator, a top-level period, a line-terminated `load`/`sload`, or bare `quit`/`q`/`exit`. It returns false for blank/comment-only input and incomplete module nesting. The probe may intern tokens into the Session but MUST NOT execute semantic state transitions.

**TNK-SESSION-004 — Synchronous execution.** `eval` does not return until the submission completes, reaches its command bound, or fails. There is no cancellation token, timeout, thread-safety, or reentrancy guarantee. Hosts requiring interruption MUST isolate execution at a process boundary.

### 17.1 Current module and inspection

```text
select NAME .
show modules .
show module [NAME] .
show views .
show view NAME .
show path [states] N .
show search graph .
show frontier states .
show most general states .
```

**TNK-SESSION-005 — Selection.** Successfully entering a module makes it current. `select NAME .` changes the current module only if the named built module exists and always clears the continuation, even when `NAME` was already current. `in M :` never changes current selection. Continuation inspection requires the originating module still to be current.

### 17.2 Settings

```text
set trace [condition|whole|substitution|rewrite|body|builtin|eqs|mbs|rls] on|off .
set include BOOL on|off .
set show breakdown on|off .
set verbose on|off .
set show timing on|off .
set memo ... .
set clear memo .
do clear memo .
```

**TNK-SESSION-006 — Settings.** Trace is off by default. `include BOOL` is off in a bare Session; while on, a newly entered module receives an implicit `including BOOL .` if `BOOL` exists. Breakdown and verbose output are off by default. Timing measurement and memoization controls are Unsupported: enabling timing or using memo controls emits an unavailable-capability warning and has no semantic effect. Other unknown `set` controls are currently silent no-ops and are Implementation-defined recovery, not supported features.

### 17.3 Loading

`load FILE` and `sload FILE` are line-terminated and do not require a period.

**TNK-LOAD-001 — Resolution.** Session `load FILE`/`sload FILE` tries the written path and then the path with `.maude` appended, first relative to the process working directory and then under each nonempty colon-separated directory in `MAUDE_LIB`. It reads UTF-8 source and evaluates it in the current Session. It does not resolve a nested load relative to the containing source file.

**TNK-LOAD-002 — Skip load.** `sload` canonicalizes a found path and silently skips it after the first load in that Session. `load` always evaluates it again. A missing/unreadable file produces an `error:` result and leaves semantic state intact except for token interning. The CLI's positional `FILE` is different: it is read exactly as written, without `.maude` completion or `MAUDE_LIB` search, and read failure is written to stderr.

### 17.4 Exit

`quit`, `q`, and `exit` set `Eval.exit = true` and produce `Bye.`. A library host decides what that means; `Session` does not terminate the process.

## 18. Output contract

### 18.1 Semantic records

**TNK-OUT-001 — Current text records.** At the Session boundary, these semantic fields are Stable when their command emits them:

- a reduce/rewrite result identifies its least sort (or explicit unknown-sort state) and term;
- a match/unifier/variant/search/narrowing record is numbered and includes its complete displayed substitution/result fields;
- an empty substitution is printed explicitly rather than by omitting the result;
- `No match.`, `No unifier.`, `No solution.`, and `No more ...` remain distinct human records;
- search solutions identify graph state plus state/rewrite statistics;
- SMT-search solutions identify symbolic state and final `where` constraint;
- diagnostic lines begin with `parse error:`, `error:`, or `warning:` according to current category.

Finite exhaustion versus a bound stop is visible only for renderers that emit a `No more ...` record. Ordinary unification and some unsupported/error paths expose no complete machine-readable classification. Clients requiring typed outcomes use the lower-level APIs.

**TNK-OUT-002 — Term rendering.** Pretty-printing MUST produce a term that reparses to a semantically equal term in the same module, subject to literal and supported grammar boundaries. It honors mixfix syntax, precedence/gather, `format`, sort disambiguation, and variable names. ANSI color never changes non-color text. Incidental parenthesis choice, whitespace, and internal AC argument order are not stable unless this Reference names the case.

**TNK-OUT-003 — Diagnostics.** At the current text boundary, severity prefix and documented state effect are Stable; full prose, punctuation, and incidental source context are human-oriented and Experimental. `Eval` does not expose structured categories. Production clients MUST NOT infer semantic control flow by matching arbitrary prose; if the stable prefix is insufficient, use a typed lower-layer `Result` or treat the operation as not programmatically classifiable.

### 18.2 Rewrite accounting

The aggregate `rewrites:` value includes successful equational/built-in replacements, membership lowerings, rule applications, symbolic variant-narrowing/narrowing steps, condition work, and explicitly transferred metalevel/external work as performed by that command. Breakdown mode reports membership, rule, variant-narrowing, and narrowing subcounts already included in the aggregate.

**TNK-COUNT-001 — Accounting scope.** A local successful equation, membership lowering, rule application, variant-narrowing step, or narrowing step contributes exactly once at its defined seam. Failed attempts do not contribute that seam's unit. A top-level command resets aggregate accounting as defined by its driver; `continue` extends the same operation.

**TNK-COUNT-002 — Diagnostic totals.** Exact large aggregate totals are diagnostic, not mathematical semantics. Evaluation strategy, canonical construction reuse, condition scheduling, and equivalent built-in implementations may change them. Clients MUST rely on exact totals only where a clause specifically defines accounting.

### 18.3 Terminal adapter

`tnk_repl::Repl` wraps `Session` and applies output wrapping once. It uses an 80-column model, keeps column 79 clear, indents continuation lines by four spaces, and breaks only at legal ASCII boundaries outside strings/ANSI sequences. Oversized tokens remain intact. The Session itself returns unwrapped output.

## 19. Command-line executable

The binary accepts:

```text
tnk-repl [-no-prelude] [-no-banner] [FILE]
```

The first non-flag argument is loaded as source. A second file argument or an unknown flag is an argument error reported to stderr with process status `2`.

**TNK-CLI-001 — Startup.** Unless `-no-banner` is supplied, the binary prints its banner. Unless `-no-prelude` is supplied, it searches `MAUDE_LIB` and then the current directory for `prelude.maude`; failure prints a warning and continues without a prelude. It then loads the optional file and enters the input loop.

Color is enabled only when stdout is a terminal. Prompts/history are enabled for terminal input. `Ctrl-C` abandons the current input buffer; `Ctrl-D` exits. A requested file or located prelude that cannot be read is reported to stderr with process status `1`; a prelude that cannot be located emits a warning and continues successfully without one. Evaluation diagnostics inside a readable file remain Session output and do not currently force a nonzero process exit.

Recommended prelude-free invocation:

```sh
cargo run --release -p tnk-repl -- -no-banner -no-prelude program.maude
```

# Part V — Rust embedding APIs

## 20. Primary Session API

```rust
use tnk_session::Session;

let mut session = Session::new();
let entered = session.eval(
    "fmod BOOLISH is sort B . ops t f : -> B . endfm",
    false,
);
assert!(!entered.exit);
assert_eq!(session.current(), Some("BOOLISH"));

let reduced = session.eval("reduce t .", false);
assert_eq!(
    reduced.output,
    "reduce in BOOLISH : t .\nrewrites: 0\nresult B: t"
);
```

**TNK-API-001 — Host ownership.** The host owns a mutable `Session` and passes complete submissions to `Session::eval`. Interactive partial input is first accumulated by the host using `Session::input_complete`; `Session::eval` itself is not a cross-call input buffer. It returns unwrapped text and never writes stdout/stderr. `Session::set_stdin` replaces the scripted input consumed by later `erewrite` `getLine` requests. `Session::current` exposes the selected module name.

`Eval.output` is presentation suitable for display, not typed control flow. A host needing typed values or completion uses the lower-level APIs; the current crate has no typed Session result surface.

## 21. Frontend and module APIs

The reusable source pipeline and its principal entry points are:

| Layer | Entry points | Result/error boundary |
|---|---|---|
| lexical | `lex::Interner`, `lex::tokenize` | token vector; lexer recovery is represented by token classes |
| surface | `surface::parser::Parser::new`, `parse_top_item`, `parse_source` | `Result<..., String>` plus retained module diagnostics |
| grammar | `grammar::build::compile_module_grammar`, `cfparser::parse_forest`/`parse_forest_pick` | compiled grammar or parse/effort error |
| direct frontend | `load_source`, `build_loaded_module`, command builders, `pretty::print_pretty` | `LoadedModule`/command owner or string diagnostic |
| module algebra | `ModuleDb`, `ViewDb`, `validate_view`, `flatten_and_build`, `load_program` | transactional `Result` at composition/build boundary |
| Session | `Session::{new,input_complete,eval,set_stdin,current}` | unwrapped `Eval` text/exit flag |
| terminal | `Repl::{new,input_complete,eval,set_stdin,current}` | wrapped `Eval`; binary owns actual terminal I/O |

**TNK-API-002 — Shared interner.** Tokens, module source, built variable names, and pretty-printing that exchange raw intern indices MUST use the same `Interner`. Intern indices are process-local implementation data, not persistent IDs.

`tnk_frontend::load_source` builds one import-free source directly. A source containing imports must go through `tnk-modules` flattening. This distinction is Stable.

## 22. Kernel API

`tnk_core::Engine` can be used without source syntax. The primary sequence is `Engine::new`, `add_sort`/`add_subsort`, `close_sorts`, signature declaration/hook registration, `Term` construction and `instantiate`, then reduction, match, rewriting, search, unification, variant, narrowing, SMT, or LTL owners. `SortId`, `KindId`, `SymbolId`, and `DagId` are engine-relative handles. `RootGuard` pins a DAG across GC-capable calls.

**TNK-API-003 — Engine isolation.** Every ID is relative to one Engine. An Engine is instance state; there is no global signature or DAG arena. A client MUST close sorts before operations that require kinds and MUST finish signature mutation before relying on cached term sorts. It MUST root DAGs that survive a GC-capable call. Passing a stale or cross-engine ID, mutating the signature out of order, or indexing a missing substitution slot violates a Rust API precondition and may panic; accepted source text must not reach those paths.

**TNK-API-004 — Resumable owners.** `Rewriting`, `Search`, `SmtSearch`, `VariantSearch`, `FilteredVariantUnifierStream`, and `NarrowSearch` retain the roots/traversal state needed between calls while borrowing an Engine only for each advancement. Dropping an owner releases its roots. The caller MUST resume with the same Engine and compatible signature. Each advancement returns a typed step/solution or `None`; algorithm-specific `incomplete` flags remain separate from exhaustion.

**TNK-API-005 — Compatibility level.** The workspace is version `0.1.0`; Rust source compatibility, exhaustive enum shape, and module path stability are Experimental. Engine memory safety, instance isolation, result soundness, and every Stable semantic clause remain release contracts.

Output spelling, enumeration order, warning prose, and aggregate-count parity with other implementations are not TNK conformance guarantees.

## 24. Unsupported and intentionally absent behavior

The following boundaries are explicit:

1. Memoization attributes/controls have no execution semantics.
2. Timing measurement is unavailable.
3. `xmatchrew` and conditional `csd` are rejected.
4. Conditional `[narrowing]` rules are diagnosed and dropped while the rest of a buildable module is retained.
5. Non-ground unification under CUI idempotence or associative one-sided identity is rejected as unsupported.
6. `smt-search =>!` is unsupported.
7. Without `smt-z3`, SMT answers are `Unknown`.
8. Conditional `metaMatch` is unsupported; deferred metalevel hook codes stay inert.
9. Ordinary search tracing is unsupported; graph/path inspection remains available.
10. Import modes do not enforce protection obligations.
11. LaTeX and filename scanner modes are outside the TNK source lexer.
12. There is no evaluation cancellation API, semantic timeout, transactional rollback of an already-running command, or concurrency guarantee.

**TNK-BOUNDARY-001 — No silent success.** Unsupported behavior MUST NOT be reported as a successful semantic result. A recognized inert hook may leave its term unreduced, but that is an explicit Unsupported outcome, not evidence the operation ran.

## 25. Resource and completeness boundaries

**TNK-RESOURCE-001 — Unbounded work.** Equational reduction, rewrite conditions, rewriting, search, strategy iteration, variants, narrowing, model checking, and solver enumeration can diverge on accepted input. A missing result before external interruption says nothing about validity.

**TNK-RESOURCE-002 — Explicit classifications.** Low-level algorithms that own an internal completeness signal expose it. User bounds, parser effort exhaustion, backend `Unknown`, solver incompleteness, unsupported theory, and finite no-solution remain distinct facts. The `Eval` text surface does not expose every distinction; completeness-sensitive clients use the typed lower-level APIs.

# Part VII — Worked normative examples

## 26. Equational normalization

```maude
fmod NAT-MINI is
  sort Nat .
  op z : -> Nat [ctor] .
  op s_ : Nat -> Nat [ctor] .
  op _+_ : Nat Nat -> Nat .

  vars M N : Nat .
  eq z + N = N .
  eq (s M) + N = s (M + N) .
endfm

reduce (s z) + (s (s z)) .
```

By `TNK-TERM-002`, `TNK-TERM-003`, and `TNK-REDUCE-001`, the result is the normal form denoting three successors of `z`, at sort `Nat`. The exact number of aggregate rewrites is not the arithmetic specification.

## 27. Reachability and continuation

```maude
mod LIGHT is
  sort State .
  ops off on broken : -> State [ctor] .
  rl [flip-on]  : off => on .
  rl [flip-off] : on  => off .
  rl [break]    : on  => broken .
endm

search [1] off =>+ broken .
continue 1 .
show path 2 .
```

`TNK-SEARCH-001` requires a deduplicated BFS graph. `broken` is reachable at depth two. `show path` uses the state number printed by the actual search result; clients must not assume a fixed number when independent same-depth successors are present.

## 28. Parameterized composition

```maude
fth TRIV is
  sort Elt .
endfth

fmod BOX{X :: TRIV} is
  sort Box{X} .
  op box : X$Elt -> Box{X} [ctor] .
endfm

fmod NAT-ELEM is
  sort Nat .
  op z : -> Nat [ctor] .
endfm

view NatAsElt from TRIV to NAT-ELEM is
  sort Elt to Nat .
endv

fmod NAT-BOX is
  protecting BOX{NatAsElt} .
endfm
```

By `TNK-MOD-004` and `TNK-VIEW-001`, instantiation maps `X$Elt` to `Nat`, producing a `box` constructor over `Nat` in the flattened module.

## 29. Host-owned Session

```rust
use tnk_session::Session;

let mut tnk = Session::new();
let definition = tnk.eval(
    "fmod ONE is sort N . op one : -> N [ctor] . endfm",
    false,
);
assert!(!definition.exit);
assert_eq!(tnk.current(), Some("ONE"));

let result = tnk.eval("reduce one .", false);
assert_eq!(
    result.output,
    "reduce in ONE : one .\nrewrites: 0\nresult N: one"
);

let quit = tnk.eval("quit", false);
assert!(quit.exit);
```

This demonstrates `TNK-SESSION-001`, `TNK-SESSION-005`, and `TNK-API-001`. A robust host should not parse arbitrary diagnostic prose from `output`; it should expose the text to a human or use a typed lower-layer interface.

# Appendix B — Glossary

- **Axiom canonicalization:** normalization by declared `assoc`, `comm`, `id`, `idem`, or `iter` structure, not by user equations.
- **Canonical state:** an equation-normal, axiom-canonical runtime term used as a search-graph key.
- **Complete result set:** every solution in the specified domain has a representative and exploration ended without a bound or incomplete flag.
- **Condition solution:** one consistent branch of left-to-right condition evaluation, including bindings introduced by matching/rewrite fragments.
- **Continuation:** a Session-owned resumable operation retaining graph/traversal state and roots.
- **Error sort:** synthesized top sort of one connected sort component (kind).
- **Flattening:** resolving a module expression/import closure into one declaration stream before frontend build.
- **Kind:** connected component of the subsort graph plus its error sort.
- **Least sort:** most specific sort assigned to a term under declarations and memberships.
- **Normal form:** a term to which no executable equation applies; for rewriting commands, “rule normal form” additionally means no selected rule transition applies.
- **Residue/extension:** the associative/AC subject portion left outside an extension match.
- **Sound solution:** substituting its bindings satisfies the defining equations/match/reachability relation.
- **Variant:** a normal form paired with the accumulated substitution that produced it by variant narrowing.

# Appendix D — Surface grammar

This appendix defines the accepted surface grammar. `Id`, `Name`, `OpName`, and `Term` are token bubbles whose final interpretation is described by §§4–6; they are not restricted to ASCII identifier syntax. A final `.` is a terminator only under `TNK-LEX-001`.

The matching close keyword is required. Module-kind gates are normative in `TNK-MOD-001`. `class`/`classes` use the parser's class-list surface; `msg`/`msgs` reuse operator declaration syntax but are object-only. `csd` is accepted but its conditional execution is Unsupported.

### D.1 Command grammar

`Bound` is a positive decimal. Bracketed `[n]` supplies a command's first bound and `[n,m]` its command-specific pair. `continue n` instead uses one bare decimal. An explicit zero is rejected; absence means unbounded within the documented algorithm and implementation resource policy.

```

`load` and `sload` accept the rest of their submission line as the path after trimming whitespace and an optional final command dot. The CLI's optional positional file is a separate adapter surface. Unknown `show` commands diagnose; unknown `set` controls are currently inert and are catalogued as Unsupported in Appendix K.

### D.2 Strategy grammar

Strategy precedence, from tightest to loosest, is postfix iteration, sequencing, choice, and ternary branch. Parentheses override it.

```text
Strategy     ::= Branch
Branch       ::= Choice ["?" Strategy ":" Branch]
Choice       ::= Sequence ("|" Sequence)*
Sequence     ::= Postfix (";" Postfix)*
Postfix      ::= StrategyAtom ("*" | "+" | "!")*
StrategyAtom ::= "idle" | "fail" | "all"
               | ("match" | "xmatch" | "amatch") Term ConditionOpt
               | ("matchrew" | "xmatchrew" | "amatchrew")
                 Term ConditionOpt "by" UsingClause
                 ("," UsingClause)*
               | ("top" | "one" | "try" | "not" | "test")
                 "(" Strategy ")"
               | "or-else" "(" Strategy "," Strategy ")"
               | RuleApplication | StrategyCall | "(" Strategy ")"
UsingClause  ::= Term "using" Strategy
RuleApplication ::= Name ["[" Term "<-" Term
                          ("," Term "<-" Term)* "]"]
                     ["{" Strategy ("," Strategy)* "}"]
StrategyCall ::= Name ["(" Term ("," Term)* ")"]
```

Rule applications may carry a label, substitutions, and `using` strategies for rule-condition fragments. Strategy calls retain term arguments as source bubbles and resolve them against declarations in the selected module. The parser accepts `csd`; resolution rejects conditional strategy definitions.

# Appendix E — Mixfix precedence and term resolution

### E.1 Grammar construction

For each valid operator declaration, TNK splits the canonical name at unescaped `_`; the number of holes equals arity. Literal fragments become terminals and holes become sort/kind nonterminals. Constants and true prefix operators add ordinary productions; a valid hole-bearing operator does not also gain a synthetic `f(a,b)` spelling. The current prefix-only fallback for a declaration whose hole count is invalid is recorded in Appendix H.4.

The current numeric precedence model is:

| Form | Default production precedence | Default gather |
|---|---:|---|
| constant or outfix/mixfix with neither end bare | `0` | internal holes `127` |
| bare unary prefix/postfix | `15` | end hole `15` |
| bare operator with two or more arguments | `41` | end/adjacent holes `41`; internal holes `127` |
| bare binary associative infix | `41` | `(e E)` = `(40, 41)` |
| explicit `prec p` | `p` | derived as below |

`127` is the unbounded `ANY` gather value. For explicit `gather`, `E` maps to `p`, `e` maps to `max(p-1,0)`, and `&` maps to `127`. Gather arity MUST equal operator arity. A child production of precedence `q` is admissible in a hole bounded by `b` iff `q <= b`. Thus smaller numbers bind more tightly, and a hole bounded below an operator's precedence excludes that operator there.

### E.2 Overload filtering

The generated grammar carries one nonterminal per sort/kind applicability profile. Parsing first enforces token shape, precedence, gather, and sort-profile reachability. Term construction then resolves overloads by canonical name and arity, retains declarations whose domains admit the argument sorts, and chooses the declaration with the greatest lower range sort. If there is no applicable declaration, or no unique least result where the owning bubble requires uniqueness, the bubble is rejected. The current first-packed-forest selection cases remain Implementation-defined under `TNK-PARSE-002`.

### E.3 Variables, literals, and disambiguation

Declared variables take their module sort. `X:Sort` creates an on-the-fly variable. A bare identifier may resolve as a declared variable, a zero-arity operator, or a recognized literal anchor; the applicable grammar and expected kind decide. Parentheses group, and `(term).Sort` forces the indicated result sort. Literal families and spacing boundaries are fixed by `TNK-LEX-003`.

# Appendix F — Declaration and statement attributes

### F.1 Operator attributes

| Source spelling | Stored meaning | Runtime effect | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `assoc` | associative theory | canonicalization, match/unify theory | Stable |
| `comm` | commutative theory | canonicalization, match/unify theory | Stable |
| `idem` | idempotent theory | canonicalization and matching | Stable |
| `id: t` | two-sided identity | canonicalization and theory solving | Stable |
| `left id: t` / `right id: t` | one-sided identity | reduction/canonicalization; not promoted to two-sided ACU | Stable |
| `iter` | iteration theory | compact `f^n(...)` syntax and reduction | Stable |
| `ctor` | constructor flag | constructor-sensitive symbolic analyses | Stable |
| `prec n` | production precedence | mixfix parsing | Stable |
| `gather (...)` | per-hole precedence bounds | mixfix parsing | Stable |
| `strat (...)` | 1-based positions ending in `0` | equational argument evaluation order | Stable |
| `frozen` / `frozen (...)` | all or selected 1-based positions | blocks rule and narrowing descent | Stable |
| `special (...)` | typed id/op/term hook attachment | built-in dispatch after hook resolution | Optional by loaded hooks |
| `ditto` | reuse preceding declaration attributes | source expansion | Stable |
| `poly (...)` | universal argument/range positions, range is `0` | one declaration instance per kind | Stable |
| `format (...)` | retained presentation metadata | no semantic reduction effect | Experimental |
| `config` | configuration constructor marker | object configuration semantics | Stable |
| `object` | object constructor role | object-message scheduling | Stable |
| `msg` | message role | object-message scheduling | Stable |
| `portal` | portal role | retained role metadata | Experimental |
| `pconst` | parameter-constant role | parameterized module composition | Stable |
| `memo` | accepted flag | warning; no memoization | Unsupported |

Attributes not listed above are rejected as unsupported operator attributes. `left` or `right` is valid only as part of an identity attribute.

### F.2 Statement attributes

| Source spelling | Applies to | Runtime effect | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[label]` | mb/eq/rule/strategy definition | names trace/rule/strategy selection | Stable |
| `[owise]` | membership/equation | tried after ordinary statements for the symbol | Stable |
| `[nonexec]` | membership/equation/rule | retained for symbolic use, excluded from ordinary execution | Stable |
| `[variant]` | membership/equation | included in variant equation family | Stable |
| `[narrowing]` | rule | included in narrowing rule family | Stable |
| `[metadata "text"]` | statement | retained metadata, no execution change | Stable |
| `[print ...]` | statement | presentation metadata only | Experimental |

Statement attributes may be comma-separated or adjacent inside one bracket list. `owise`, `variant`, and `nonexec` are semantic selectors, not comments. Unknown statement attributes are invalid input; their current equation/rule and membership recovery paths are nonuniform and are catalogued in Appendix H.4. Portable source MUST NOT rely on either rejection or silent retention.

# Appendix G — Built-in hook catalogue

Built-ins are activated by resolved `special` attachments; spelling alone does not make an operator built-in. The id-hook names below are the accepted dispatch keys in this release.

### G.1 Literal anchors and ordinary special operators

| Id-hook class | Required/recognized data | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `SuccSymbol` | `zeroTerm`; optional minus hook | natural numeral anchor |
| `StringSymbol`, `FloatSymbol`, `QuotedIdentifierSymbol` | class marker | literal anchor |
| `SystemTrue`, `SystemFalse` | class marker | Boolean result anchors |
| `SMT_NumberSymbol` | `integers` or `reals` | SMT literal anchor |
| `ObjectConstructorSymbol` | object/configuration hooks | ordinary constructor plus object-pattern metadata |
| `MinusSymbol`, `DivisionSymbol` | natural hooks | signed integer and rational construction |
| `EqualitySymbol` | `equalTerm`, `notEqualTerm` | structural equality |
| `CommutativeDecomposeEqualitySymbol` | equality terms; optional conjunction/disjunction | constructor-sensitive decomposing equality |
| `BranchSymbol` | numbered term hooks | lazy branch selection |
| `RandomOpSymbol` | natural hooks | deterministic MT19937 stream |
| `CounterSymbol` | natural hooks | per-top-level-rewrite counter |

Numeric operation classes are `ACU_NumberOpSymbol`, `CUI_NumberOpSymbol`, and `NumberOpSymbol`. Supported operation codes are `+`, `*`, `gcd`, `lcm`, `min`, `max`, `xor`, `&`, `|`, `sd`, `-`, `quo`, `rem`, `^`, `modExp`, `>>`, `<<`, `abs`, `~`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, and `divides`, subject to the class's arity/theory and `TNK-BUILTIN-001`.

`StringOpSymbol` supports `+`, `length`, `substr`, `ascii`, `char`, `find`, `rfind`, `upperCase`, `lowerCase`, `cntrl`, `print`, `space`, `blank`, `graph`, `punct`, `alnum`, `alpha`, `isupper`, `islower`, `digit`, `xdigit`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `ltrim`, `rtrim`, `trim`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`.

`FloatOpSymbol` supports unary `-`, `abs`, `sqrt`, `floor`, `ceiling`, `exp`, `log`, `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `asin`, `acos`, unary/binary `atan`, `+`, binary `-`, `*`, `/`, `rem`, `^`, `min`, `max`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`. Conversion hooks cover rational-to-float, float-to-rational, rational/float-to-string, string-to-rational/float, and decimal-float formatting. `QuotedIdentifierOpSymbol` supports Qid/string conversion plus `tokenize` and `printTokens`.

### G.2 SMT, temporal, meta, and external classes

| Id-hook class | Supported family | Capability condition |
|---|---|---|
| `SMT_Symbol` | Boolean connectives; integer/real arithmetic and order; equality, `ite`, divisibility, casts and `isInteger` | representation always; solving depends on profile |
| `ModelCheckerSymbol` | LTL model checking and counterexample construction | all temporal/result hooks resolve |
| `SatSolverSymbol` | LTL satisfiability/model construction | all temporal/formula/model hooks resolve |
| `MetaLevelOpSymbol` | reflected descent operations below | canonical meta hooks resolve |
| `InterpreterManagerSymbol` | synchronous child-Session manager | META-INTERPRETER protocol loaded |
| `StreamManagerSymbol` | `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr` manager | stream code and message hooks resolve |

The exact `SMT_Symbol` codes are `true`, `false`, `not`, `and`, `or`, `xor`, `implies`, `===`, `=/==`, `ite`, unary/binary `-`, `+`, `*`, `div`, `mod`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `divisible`, `/`, `toReal`, `toInteger`, and `isInteger`.

The native META-LEVEL dispatch keys are:

- execution: `metaReduce`, `metaNormalize`, `metaRewrite`, `metaFrewrite`, `metaApply`, `metaXapply`;
- matching/search: `metaMatch`, `metaXmatch`, `metaSearch`, `metaSearchPath`, `metaCheck`, `metaSmtSearch`;
- variant satisfiability: `variantSat`, `variantSatWithSorts`, `variantValid`, `variantValidWithSorts`, `variantSatWellFormed`;
- sort inspection: `metaSortLeq`, `metaSameKind`, `metaLesserSorts`, `metaGlbSorts`, `metaLeastSort`, `metaCompleteName`, `metaGetKind`, `metaGetKinds`, `metaMaximalSorts`, `metaMinimalSorts`, `metaMaximalAritySet`;
- parsing and validation: `metaParse`, `metaPrettyPrint`, `metaPrintToString`, `metaWellFormedModule`, `metaWellFormedTerm`, `metaWellFormedSubstitution`;
- reflection: `metaUpModule`, `metaUpImports`, `metaUpSorts`, `metaUpSubsortDecls`, `metaUpOpDecls`, `metaUpMbs`, `metaUpEqs`, `metaUpRls`, `metaUpStratDecls`, `metaUpSds`, `metaUpView`, `metaUpTerm`, `metaDownTerm`;
- unification: `metaUnify`, `metaDisjointUnify`, `metaIrredundantUnify`, `metaIrredundantDisjointUnify`, and the two `legacyMeta*Unify` forms;
- variants/narrowing: `metaGetVariant`, `metaGetIrredundantVariant`, their supported signatures, `metaVariantUnify`, `metaVariantDisjointUnify`, `metaVariantMatch`, `metaNarrow`, `metaNarrowingApply`, `metaNarrowingSearch`, and `metaNarrowingSearchPath`.

`metaNarrow2` is recognized but inert. An unknown `MetaLevelOpSymbol` code maps to an inert `Unknown` operation. Unsupported id-hook classes such as `MatrixOpSymbol` and `LoopSymbol` leave their operators ordinary and currently produce no explicit diagnostic.

# Appendix H — Observable result and diagnostic schema

### H.1 Public record

The only stable public Session record shape in this release is:

```text
Eval {
  output: String,  // zero or more unwrapped presentation blocks
  exit: bool       // true only for quit/q/exit
}
```

`Session::eval` does not expose a typed status, semantic value, solution vector, diagnostic code, completion bit, or continuation handle. A caller MUST NOT infer control flow from arbitrary prose. Clients that need algebraic results, completeness, or structured failures use the frontend, module, or kernel APIs.

### H.2 Presentation records

With color disabled, the stable semantic fields are:

| Record | Required fields | Completion marker |
|---|---|---|
| reduce/rewrite/frewrite/erewrite | command echo; `rewrites: N`; `result SORT: TERM` or `result (sort not calculated): TERM` | result line |
| match/xmatch | command echo; zero or more numbered matcher blocks; bindings; xmatch residue when present | `No match.`, `No more matches.`, or eager end |
| search | command echo; `Solution N (state K)`; `states: S  rewrites: R`; bindings | `No more solutions.` only on exhaustion |
| SMT search | solution number; rewrite count; `state: TERM`; bindings; `where FORMULA` | `No solution.` / `No more solutions.` |
| unification | command echo; numbered `Unifier` blocks; bindings | `No unifier.` / `No more unifiers.` when represented |
| variants | numbered `Variant`; rewrite count; `SORT: TERM`; bindings | `No more variants.` |
| variant unify/match | numbered `Unifier` or `Matcher`; rewrite count; bindings | `No ...` / `No more ...` |
| narrowing | numbered state/solution, rewrite count, state term, accumulated substitution, optional variant unifier | no-more marker only on exhaustion |
| strategy rewrite | numbered result; rewrite count; `result SORT: TERM` | eager end after all results |
| check | command presentation plus a `Sat`, `Unsat`, or `Unknown` backend answer; current `BadDag` omission is recorded in Appendix H.4 | one answer except for the current `BadDag` gap |
| show/select/set/load | command-specific text or empty success | return from call |

A bounded resumable invocation that stops exactly at its requested prefix emits no no-more marker and retains a matching continuation. Eager commands (`match`, `xmatch`, strategy rewrite, and bounded object-level unify) do not create a continuation. `continue` output appends records from the saved operation and emits its completion marker only when exhaustion is observed.

Trace blocks, breakdown rows, verbose statistics, ANSI color, whitespace wrapping, source excerpts, and diagnostic prose are Experimental presentation. Counts are semantic only where `TNK-COUNT-*` or a command clause names them.

### H.3 Diagnostic ownership and state effect

This table is the intended ownership model. The current implementation exceptions in H.4 control the description of what workspace version `0.1.0` actually does for the specifically named invalid inputs; they are not accepted-language guarantees.

| Category | Owner | Required Session state effect |
|---|---|---|
| lexical/source parse | frontend source parser | current module, databases, and continuation unchanged |
| declaration/statement | frontend builder | invalid module definition is not installed; statement-local failures follow `TNK-STMT-001` |
| module/view composition | module layer | attempted definition is atomic; prior definition and dependents remain |
| command parse/build | frontend/Session command boundary | no semantic execution; prior continuation remains only where `TNK-SESSION-003` permits |
| unsupported capability | owning feature boundary | no false success or exhaustion claim |
| user bound | command enumerator | finite prefix; continuation retained only for resumable families |
| solver `Unknown`/`BadDag` | SMT boundary | intended to be reported distinctly from `Sat`/`Unsat`; the current Session `BadDag` omission is in H.4 |
| internal incompleteness | unification/variant/narrowing boundary | distinct from exhausted/no-solution |
| external I/O | Session external manager/load boundary | error returned as text; process remains live |
| resource exhaustion | parser/algorithm boundary | distinct from malformed input and semantic exhaustion |

The category table defines semantic ownership; `Eval` does not currently carry a machine-readable category enum. Clients use a stable documented prefix plus state effect or a typed lower-level API.

### H.4 Tentative invalid-input and recovery ledger

**TNK-RECOVERY-001 — Current invalid-input behavior.** The tables below record actual workspace-version-`0.1.0` behavior at known malformed, statically invalid, or unsupported input seams. This entire surface is **Experimental, tentative, and in flux**. It is diagnostic documentation, not a supported recovery API: it does not enlarge the accepted grammar, promise that a repaired declaration or retained statement will keep working, or grant compatibility to a missing diagnostic or panic. For the named cases, the tables describe the current implementation even where it deviates from `TNK-DOC-003`, `TNK-DOC-006`, `TNK-STMT-001`, or H.3.

**Practical rule:** submit only well-formed, statically valid, supported TNK input. Do not use skipped tokens, repaired declarations, dropped statements, inert hooks, silent commands, or process failure as a programming technique. Portable programs MUST NOT depend on any behavior in this section. If input satisfies the grammar and static requirements in Parts I–III, these invalid-input seams are avoidable.

Here, **silent** means that `Session::eval` adds no diagnostic text for the named problem. A later recognized item may still produce its ordinary output.

#### H.4.1 Source, declaration, and statement seams

| Incorrect input or seam | Current diagnostic | Current state/evaluation effect |
|---|---|---|
| unrecognized top-level tokens before a recognized module, view, or command opener | silent for the skipped tokens | tokens are discarded one at a time; the next recognized suffix in the same submission is parsed and executed with its normal state effects |
| two commands on one physical line | `error: more than one command on a line.` | the physical-line command group is rejected before either command is dispatched |
| mixfix operator name whose `_` count differs from its arity | silent | no mixfix production is installed; the declaration remains callable in prefix form using its full declared name and arity |
| nonbinary or kind-incompatible `assoc`, `comm`, `idem`, identity, or `iter` attribute | silent | the invalid algebraic flag is cleared; the declaration remains installed with any independently valid surviving flags, otherwise as a free operator |
| `frozen (...)` containing an argument position outside the declaration's arity | silent | the complete `frozen` attribute is ignored and the declaration remains installed |
| unknown operator attribute or unknown `special` subdirective | `parse error:` | the submitted module definition is not installed; this differs from an unknown `id-hook` class below |
| ordinary statement whose term, variables, condition, or `[print ...]` data fails frontend construction | `warning:` naming a dropped equation, membership, or rule | that statement is omitted; the enclosing buildable module and later valid statements are retained |
| trailing equation/rule bracket group whose first token is not a recognized statement attribute | no attribute-specific diagnostic; a downstream dropped-statement warning is emitted if the resulting term bubble does not parse | the bracket group remains part of the statement term bubble rather than being peeled as attributes; if that bubble parses, its term meaning controls |
| unknown token after a recognized first attribute in an equation/rule bracket group | silent for the unknown token | the token is consumed, recognized attributes still apply, and the statement remains installed if its terms build |
| unknown token in a membership attribute group | silent for the unknown token | the token is consumed and the membership remains installed if its term and target sort build |
| conditional rule carrying `[narrowing]` | `warning:` naming a dropped rule | the entire rule is omitted; the enclosing module and later valid statements are retained |
| cyclic subsort declarations | Rust panic text is written by the panic hook, not returned as an `Eval` diagnostic | sort closure panics; under the default CLI build the process exits with status `101`, and no Session recovery or state-preservation guarantee applies |

#### H.4.2 Unsupported and silent command/hook seams

| Input or outcome | Current diagnostic/output | Current state/evaluation effect |
|---|---|---|
| recognized `id-hook` class with no TNK implementation, or an unknown special id-hook class | silent | no `SpecialOp` is attached; the operator remains ordinary and may still reduce through user equations |
| unknown `set` control, unsupported `set include` module, or unrecognized value on the include/breakdown/verbose/timing paths | silent | the directive is consumed and the corresponding Session setting is unchanged |
| `set memo ...`, `set clear memo`, `do clear memo`, or `set show timing on` | `warning:` that the capability is unavailable | no memo table or timing mode is enabled; other Session state is unchanged |
| ordinary unification rejected by low-level unsupported-theory readiness | command echo only; no warning, unifier, `No unifier.`, or completion marker | no unifier stream or continuation is created |
| `check` whose configured SMT backend returns `BadDag` | command echo only; no backend-answer line | the prior continuation has already been cleared; no satisfiability claim is made |

These rows intentionally expose inconsistencies rather than synthesizing a general recovery principle. They are expected to change when invalid-input handling is made uniform.

# Appendix I — Rust API map

### I.1 Supported public entry points

| Crate | Entry point | Contract and principal clauses |
|---|---|---|
| `tnk-session` | `Session::new()` | creates isolated persistent state; `TNK-SESSION-001` |
| `tnk-session` | `Session::eval(&str, bool) -> Eval` | complete submission to unwrapped output; `TNK-SESSION-*`, `TNK-OUT-*`, Appendix H |
| `tnk-session` | `Session::input_complete(&mut self, &str) -> bool` | host-side submission completeness probe; `TNK-SESSION-004` |
| `tnk-session` | `Session::set_stdin(impl Into<String>)` | replaces scripted input for external `getLine`; `TNK-API-001` |
| `tnk-session` | `Session::current() -> Option<&str>` | current selected module name |
| `tnk-repl` | `Repl::new(bool)` | terminal policy wrapper with fixed color selection |
| `tnk-repl` | `Repl::eval(&mut self, &str) -> Eval` | Session evaluation plus exactly one wrapping pass |
| `tnk-repl` | `Repl::input_complete`, `set_stdin`, `current` | forwards the corresponding Session behavior |
| `tnk-frontend` | `lex::tokenize`, `Interner` | lexical tokenization and interned source names; `TNK-LEX-*` |
| `tnk-frontend` | `surface::parse` | parses modules, views, and top-level command AST; `TNK-PARSE-*` |
| `tnk-frontend` | `load::load_program` | parse/build runnable program; `TNK-API-002` |
| `tnk-frontend` | `sig::build_loaded_module`, `sig::rebuild_loaded_module` | lower-level signature/build path |
| `tnk-frontend` | `pretty::print_pretty`, `print_raw` | term rendering; presentation clauses apply |
| `tnk-frontend` | `strategy::execute` | strategy execution over a loaded module; `TNK-STRAT-*` |
| `tnk-modules` | `ModuleDb`, `ViewDb` | persistent named source storage |
| `tnk-modules` | `flatten`, `load`, `view`, `meta`, `prelude` module APIs | composition/build/reflection/prelude mechanisms; `TNK-MOD-*`, `TNK-VIEW-001` |
| `tnk-core` | `Engine` and public term/sort/symbol IDs | engine-relative kernel construction and evaluation |
| `tnk-core` | public rewrite/search/unify/variant/narrow/SMT records | lower-level resumable semantic engines; corresponding Part III clauses |

The crate roots expose additional structural types needed to construct signatures and inspect lower-level results. Those types are supported only with their Rust type invariants; source-language conformance belongs to the frontend/module/Session entry points. Engine-relative IDs MUST NOT be mixed across engines.

### I.2 Ownership and lifetime invariants

- A `Session` owns its `Interner`, module/view databases, loaded engines, continuations, reflection caches, and external managers.
- A `LoadedModule` owns one `Engine`; its `DagId`, `SortId`, `SymbolId`, and continuation records are engine-relative.
- GC safety requires live DAGs retained by engine roots/guards or by owning sessions. Callers do not receive stable raw references through `Session::eval`.
- Module flattening transforms source `PreModule` values before frontend build; redefining a source invalidates and rebuilds transitive dependents.
- Public Rust signatures, not examples in this appendix, are the compile-time authority. Semantic methods link back to the relevant `TNK-*` clauses.

### I.3 Host pattern

```rust
use tnk_session::{Eval, Session};

fn submit(session: &mut Session, source: &str) -> Eval {
    assert!(session.input_complete(source));
    session.eval(source, false)
}
```

Hosts accumulating interactive lines call `input_complete` on the accumulated buffer and call `eval` only when it returns true. Batch hosts may pass complete multi-statement submissions directly. `Eval.output` is displayed, not reparsed as a typed protocol.

# Appendix J — Feature status and conformance profiles

| REPL adapter, CLI flags, fixed 80-column wrapping | Stable | executable profile |
| human output prose, whitespace, color, trace formatting, verbose/breakdown layout | Experimental | semantic fields in Appendix H remain contractual |
| exact result enumeration order unless explicitly named | Implementation-defined behavior | clients must not rely on one ordering |

### J.1 Build profiles

| Profile | Selection | Required behavior |
|---|---|---|
| default | default crate features | pure-Rust build; SMT requests return `Unknown` |
| `smt-z3` | enable the member crate's `smt-z3` feature | real `Sat`, `Unsat`, `Unknown`, and `BadDag` outcomes from the configured backend |
| default no-prelude CLI | `tnk-repl -no-banner -no-prelude` | no stock module is assumed; self-contained source works |
| library-backed CLI | set `MAUDE_LIB`, run ordinary `tnk-repl` | prelude and hook-backed capabilities are available only after successful load |

There is no root package feature named `smt-z3`; workspace `--all-features` enables the same-named features in member crates.

### J.2 Runtime capability sets

Loaded modules form an explicit runtime capability set:

- no prelude is injected into the kernel, frontend, module, or Session libraries;
- `tnk-repl` alone attempts to locate and load `prelude.maude`, unless `-no-prelude`;
- object modules request the bundled `CONFIGURATION` source through module-layer injection;
- optional `share/tnk` facades still require their referenced stock/external libraries;
- a hook-dependent clause applies only after its declaration and every required hook resolve.

Missing optional libraries must produce a load/build/unsupported outcome. They must not silently replace a solver with a positive answer or claim a language feature is active.

# Appendix K — Unsupported, incomplete, and deferred surfaces

### K.1 Explicitly Unsupported

| Surface | Current behavior | Observable boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `memo` operator attribute and `set memo`/`set clear memo` | accepted; warning; no cache semantics | warning and unchanged reduction semantics |
| `set show timing on` | warning; timing remains disabled | no timing rows and state unchanged |
| conditional strategy definition `csd` | parses; rejected during strategy resolution | rejection, no partial definition |
| conditional narrowing rule | warning; the invalid rule statement is dropped | enclosing module and later valid statements remain installed; see H.4 |
| non-ground unification under idempotent CUI or one-sided-identity associative theories | low-level problem is unsupported; no ordinary unifier stream | object-level Session currently emits only the command echo; no warning or no-unifier marker |
| SMT-search `=>!` | command rejects mode | no search/continuation created |
| conditional constraint in reflected `metaMatch` | unsupported at reflected boundary | no unrelated dispatch |
| `metaNarrow2` state-only dispatch | recognized but inert | term remains unreduced or explicit facade failure |
| unknown META-LEVEL operation code | maps to inert `Unknown` | no fallback to another MetaOp |
| unknown special id-hook classes, including matrix/loop families | operator remains ordinary/inert | no explicit diagnostic and no false built-in result |
| unknown Session `set` control | inert | no explicit diagnostic and no state change |
| cooperative cancellation, semantic timeouts, and async Session evaluation | no API | hosts must provide process/thread policy; timeout is not no-solution |
| typed Session result/diagnostic stream | no API; `Eval` is text plus exit | use lower-level APIs for typed control flow |

Unsupported syntax recognized at a public boundary should diagnose under `TNK-DOC-006`. Appendix H.4 catalogs the current silent, repaired, dropped, and panic paths without promoting them to supported behavior.

### K.2 Sound but potentially incomplete

| Operation | Incompleteness source | Machine-readable boundary |
|---|---|---|
| AU/nonlinear unification | infinite family or bounded word exploration | `UnifyProblem::is_incomplete()` |
| ordinary Session unify | low-level incompleteness may occur | not exposed in `Eval`; Experimental presentation |
| variant unification/matching | variant search or nested unifier incomplete | low-level stream/search state |
| variant narrowing | nested unification/variant incomplete or depth bound | low-level narrowing result/session |
| search/narrowing | explicit depth/result bound | absence of no-more marker plus retained continuation where supported |
| SMT search | any encountered `Unknown` or `BadDag`, or an explicit search bound | backend result is available internally; Session output does not enumerate pruned unknown states |
| infinite rewrite/search/model-check state space | semantic divergence | no implicit timeout/cutoff |

Every returned result remains subject to its soundness clause. Incomplete means “no completeness claim,” never “probably complete” and never “no solution.”

Variant satisfiability returns `Decision::Rejected(EligibilityRejection)` rather than a Boolean for membership axioms; associative noncommutative constructors; inconsistent overloaded constructor axioms; overlapping, unknown, or false sort overrides; identity classifications requiring an override; an empty requested finite sort; constructor preregularity failure; variant-search setup failure; or incomplete variant search.

### K.3 Deferred and implementation-defined

- META-LEVEL up-mapping for some flat modules containing `special` or `poly` declarations may return the facade's deferred/failure value.
- Result ordering, generated fresh-variable spelling, internal state numbers outside documented graph records, packed-forest first-choice order, and many diagnostic wordings are Implementation-defined.
- `format`, `[print ...]`, portal metadata, trace prose, and line wrapping are Experimental presentation.
- Import-mode algebraic obligations beyond the current flattening effect are Experimental.
- Source/command resource limits are fixed where a clause names one; execution has no general semantic timeout.
